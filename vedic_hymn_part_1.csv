Wilson: The circumstationed (inhabitants of the three worlds) associate with (Indra), the mighty (Sun), the indestructive (fire), the moving (wind), and the lights that shine in the sky.
Benfey: Die rothe Sonne schirr’n sie an, die wandelt um die stehenden, Strahlen strahlen am Himmel auf.
Ludwig: Sie spannen an den hellen, den roten, den vom feststehenden hinwegwandelnden; heller glanz erstralt am Himmel.
Note 1. The poet begins with a somewhat abrupt description of a sunrise. Indra is taken as the god of the bright day, whose steed is the sun, and whose companions the Maruts, or the storm-gods. Arushá, meaning originally red, is used as a proper name of the horse or of the rising sun, though it occurs more frequently as the name of the red horses or flames of Agni, the god of fire, and also of the morning light. In our passage, Arushá, a substantive, meaning the red of the morning, has taken bradhná as an
p. 17
adjective,—bradhná meaning, as far as can be made out, bright in general, though, as it is especially applied to the Soma-juice, perhaps bright-brown or yellow. Names of colour are difficult to translate from one language into another, for their shades vary, and withdraw themselves from sharp definition. We shall meet with this difficulty again and again in the Veda; see RV. X, 20, 9.
As it has actually been doubted whether bradhná arushá can be meant for the sun, and whether the Vedic poets ever looked upon the sun as a horse, I may quote Vâg. Samh. XXIII, 4, where the same verse occurs and is declared to be addressed to the sun; and Satap. Br. XIII, 2, 6, 1, where we read, yuñganti bradhnam arusham karantam iti, asau vâ âdityo bradhnoऽrushoऽmum evâsmâ âdityam yunakti svargasya lokasya samashtyai. Ludwig remarks justly that the sun has been conceived as a chariot also, and that bradhná arushá may have been thus understood here. Delbrück translates quite boldly: Sie schirren die rothe Sonne an. See also Tait. Br. III, 7, 7, 4; Tândya Br. XXIII, 3, 5; Sâṅkh. Br. II, 17, 3; Ludwig, Comm. ii. p. 173. M. Bergaigne (Rél. Ved. iii. p. 324) remarks very truly: 'Le soleil est tantôt une roue, tantôt un char, tantôt un cheval, trainant le char, tantôt un héros monté sur le char et dirigeant les chevaux.'
The following passages will illustrate the principal meaning of arushá, and justify the translation here adopted.

1,"MANDALA I, HYMN 6.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 11-12.","Arushá, as an Adjective.","Arushá is used as an adjective in the sense of red:

His (Agni's) path is black, white, red, bright, reddish, and yellow.
Here it is extremely difficult to keep all the colours distinct.
Arushá is frequently applied to Soma, particularly in the 9th Mandala. There we read:
IX, 8, 6. arusháh hárih. IX, 71, 7. arusháh diváh kavíh vríshâ. IX, 74, 1. vâ´gî´ arusháh. IX, 82, 1. arusháh vríshâ hárih. IX, 89, 3. hárim arushám.
IX, 111, 1. arusháh hárih. See also IX, 25, 5; 61, 21.
In IX, 72, 1, arushá seems used as a substantive in the sense of red-horse.
p. 19
Professor Spiegel, in his important review of my translation (Heidelberger Jahrbücher, 1870, p. 104), points out that aurusha in Zend means white, so that it would seem as if the original meaning of arusha had been bright, bright like fire, and thus red.
"
2,"MANDALA I, HYMN 6.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 11-12.","Arushá, as an Appellative.","Arushá is used as an appellative, and in the following senses:
1. The one red-horse of the Sun, the two or more red-horses of Agni.
I, 6, 1. yuñgánti bradhnám arushám.
They yoke the bright red-horse (the Sun).
I, 94, 10. yát áyukthâh arushâ´ róhitâ ráthe.
When thou (Agni) hadst yoked the two red-horses and the two ruddy horses to the chariot. 1, 146, 2.
II, 10, 2. sruyâ´h agníh—hávam me—syâvâ´ rátham vahatah róhitâ vâ utá arushâ´.
Mayest thou, Agni, hear my call, whether the two black, or the two ruddy, or the two red-horses carry you.
Here three kinds of colours are clearly distinguished, and an intentional difference is made between róhita and arushá. IV, 2, 3.
IV, 6, 9. táva tyé agne harítah—róhitâsah—arushâ´sah vríshanah.
To thee (Agni) belong these bays, these ruddy, these red-horses, the stallions.
Here, again, three kinds of horses are distinguished—Haríts, Róhitas, and Arushás.
VIII, 34, 17. yé rigrah vâ´ta-ramhasah arushâ´sah raghusyádah.
Here arushá may be the subject, and the rest adjectives; but it is also possible to fake all the words as adjectives, referring them to âsú in the next verse. The fact that rigrá likewise expresses a peculiar red colour, is no objection, as may be seen from I, 6, I; 94, 10.
VII, 42, 2. yuṅkshvá—harítah rohítah ka yé vâ sádman arushâ´h.
p. 20
Yoke (O Agni) the bays, and the ruddy horses, or the red-horses which are in thy stable. VII, 16, 2.
2. The cloud, represented as one of the horses of the Maruts.
I, 85, 5. utá arushásya ví syanti dhâ´râh.
(When you go to the battle, O Maruts), the streams of the red (horse) flow off.
V, 56, 7. utá syáh vâ´gî´ arusháh.
This strong red-horse,—meant for one of the horses of the Maruts, but, at the same time, as sending rain.
"
3,"MANDALA I, HYMN 6.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 11-12.","Arushá, as the Proper Name of a Solar Deity.","Besides the passages in which arushá is used either as an adjective, in the sense of red, or as an appellative, meaning some kind of horse, there are others in which, as I pointed out in my Essay on Comparative Mythology a, Arushá occurs as a proper name, as the name of a solar deity, as the bright deity of the morning (Morgenroth). My interpretation of some of these passages has been contested, nor shall I deny that in some of them a different interpretation is possible, and that in looking for traces of Arushá, as a Vedic deity, representing the morning or the rising sun, and containing, as I endeavoured to show, the first germs of the Greek name of Eros, I may have seen more indications of the presence of that deity in the Veda than others would feel inclined to acknowledge. Yet in going over the same ground again, I think that even verses which for a time I felt inclined to surrender, yield a better sense, if we take the word arushá, which occurs in them as a substantive, as the name of a matutinal deity, than if we look upon it as an adjective or a mere appellative. It might be said that wherever this arushá occurs, apparently as the name of a deity, we ought to supply Agni or Indra or Sûrya. This is true to a certain extent, for the sun, or the light of the morning, or the bright sky form no doubt the substance and

p. 21
subject-matter of this deity. But the same applies to many other names originally intended for these conceptions, but which, nevertheless, in the course of time, became independent names of independent deities. In our passage I, 6, 1, yuñgánti bradhnám arushám, we may retain for arushá the appellative power of steed or red-steed, but if we could ask the poet what he meant by this red-steed, or if we ask ourselves what we can possibly understand by it, the answer would be, the morning sun, or the light of the morning. In other passages, however, this meaning of red-steed is really no longer applicable, and we can only translate Arushá by the Red, understanding by this name the deity of the morning or of the morning sun, the later Aruna.
VII, 71, 1. ápa svásuh ushâsah nák gihîte rinákti krishnî´h arushâ´ya pánthâm.
The Night retires from her sister, the Dawn; the Dark one yields the path to the Red one, i. e. the red morning.
Here Arushá shares the same half-mythological character as Ushas. Where we should speak of dawn and morning as mere periods of time, the Vedic poet speaks of them as living and intelligent beings, half human, half divine, as powers of nature capable of understanding his prayers, and powerful enough to reward his praises. I do not think therefore that we need hesitate to take Arushá in this passage as a proper name of the morning, or of the morning sun, to whom the dark goddess, the Night, yields the path when he rises in the East.
VI, 49, 2. diváh sísum sáhasah sûnúm agním yagñásya ketúm arushám yágadhyai.
To worship the child of Dyu, the son of strength, Agni, the light of the sacrifice, the Red one (Arushá.).
In this verse, where the name of Agni actually occurs, it would be easier than in the preceding verse to translate arushá as an adjective, referring it either to Agni, the god of fire, or to yagñásya ketúm, the light of the sacrifice. I had myself yielded a so far to these considerations that I

p. 22
gave up my former translation, and rendered this verse by 'to worship Agni, the child of the sky, the son of strength, the red light of the sacrifice a.' But I return to my original translation, and I prefer to see in Arushá an independent name, intended, no doubt, for Agni, as the representative of the rising sun and, at the same time, of the sacrificial fire of the morning, but nevertheless as having in the mind of the poet a personality of his own. He is the child of Dyu, originally the offspring of heaven. He is the son of strength, originally generated by the strong rubbing of the aranis, i. e. the wood for kindling fire. He is the light of the sacrifice, whether as reminding man that the time for the morning sacrifice has come, or as himself lighting the sacrifice on the Eastern altar of the sky. He is Arushá, originally as clothed in bright red colour, but gradually changed into the representative of the morning. We see at once, if examining these various expressions, how some of them, like the child of Dyu, are easily carried away into mythology, while others, such as the son of strength, or the light of the sacrifice, resist that unconscious metamorphosis. That Arushá was infected by mythology, that it had approached at least that point where nomina become changed into numina, we see by the verse immediately following:
VI, 49, 3. arushásya duhitárâ vírûpe (íti ví-rûpe) stríbhih anyâ´ pipisé sû´rah anyâ´.
There are two different daughters of Arushá; the one is clad in stars, the other belongs to the sun, or is the wife of Svar.
Here Arushá is clearly a mythological being, like Agni or Savitar or Vaisvânara; and if Day and Night are called his daughters, he, too, can hardly have been conceived otherwise than as endowed with human attributes, as the child of Dyu, as the father of Day and Night, and not as a mere period of time, not as a mere cause or effect.
IV, 15, 6. tám árvantam ná sânasím arushám ná diváh sísum marmrigyánte divé-dive.

p. 23
They trim the fire day by day, like a strong horse, like Arushá, the child of Dyu.
Here, too, Arushá, the child of Dyu, has to be taken as a personal character, and, if the ná after arushám is right, a distinction is clearly made between Agni, the sacrificial fire, to whom the hymn is addressed, and Arushá, the child of heaven, the pure and bright morning, here used as a simile for the cleaning or trimming of the fire on the altar.
V, 47, 3. arusháh su-parnáh.
Arushá, the morning sun, with beautiful wings.
"
4,"MANDALA I, HYMN 6.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 11-12.","The Feminine Árushî, as an Adjective.","Árushî, like arushá, is used as an adjective, in the same sense as arushá, i. e. red:
III, 55, 11. syâ´vî ka yát árushî ka svásârau.
As the dark and the red are sisters.
I, 92, 1 and 2. gâ´vah árushîh and árushîh gâ´h.
The red cows of the dawn.
I, 92, 2. rûsantam bhânúm árushîh asisrayuh.
The red dawns obtained bright splendour.
Here ushásah, the dawns, occur in the same line, so that we may take árushîh either as an adjective, referring to the dawns, or as a substantive, as a name of the dawn or of her cows.
I, 30, 21. ásve ná kitre arushi.
Thou beautiful red dawn, thou, like a mare.
Here, too, the vocative arushi is probably to be taken as an adjective, particularly if we consider the next following verse:
IV, 52, 2. ásvâ-iva kitrâ´ árushî mâtâ´ gávâm ritá-varî sákhâ abhût asvínoh ushâ´h.
The dawn, beautiful and red, like-a mare, the mother of the cows (days), the never-failing, she became the friend of the Asvins.
X, 5, 5. saptá svásrîh árushîh.
The seven red sisters.
p. 24
"
5,"MANDALA I, HYMN 6.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 11-12.","The Feminine Árushî, as a Substantive.","If used as a substantive, árushî seems to mean the dawn. It is likewise used as a name of the horses of Agni, Indra, and Soma; also as a name for mare in general.
It means dawn in X, 8, 3, though the text points here so clearly to the dawn, and the very name of dawn is mentioned so immediately after, that this one passage seems hardly sufficient to establish the use of árushî as a recognised name of the dawn. Other passages, however, would likewise gain in perspicuity, if we took árushî by itself as a name of the dawn, just as we had to admit in several passages arushá by itself as a name of the morning. Cf. I, 71, 1.
Árushî means the horses of Agni, in I, 14, 12:
yukshvá hí árushîh ráthe harítah deva rohítah.
Yoke, O god (Agni), the red-horses to the chariot, the bays, the ruddy.
I, 72, 10. prá nî´kîh agne árushîh agânan.
They knew the red-horses, Agni, coming down. VIII, 69, 5.
Soma, as we saw, was frequently spoken of as arusháh hárih.
In IX, 111, 2, tridhâ´tubhih árushîbhih seems to refer to the same red-horses of Soma, though this is not quite clear.
The passages where árushî means simply a mare, without any reference to colour, are VIII, 68, 18, and VIII, 55, 3.
It is curious that Arushá, which in the Veda means red, should, as pointed out before, in its Zend form aurusha, mean white. That in the Veda it means red, and not white, is shown, for instance, by X, 20, 9, where svetá, the name for white, is mentioned by the side of arushá. Most likely arushá meant originally brilliant, and became fixed with different shades of brilliancy in Sanskrit and Persian. Arushá presupposes a form ar-vas, and is derived from a root ar in the sense of running or rushing. See Chips from a German Workshop, vol. ii, pp. 135, 137.
p. 25
Having thus explained the different meanings of arushá and árushî in the Rig-veda, I feel it incumbent, at least for once, to explain the reasons why I differ from the classification of Vedic passages as given in the Dictionary published by Boehtlingk and Roth. Here, too, the passages in which arushá is used as an adjective are very properly separated from those in which it appears as a substantive. To begin with the first, it is said that 'arushá means ruddy, the colour of Agni and his horses; he (Agni) himself appears as a red-horse.' In support of this, the following passages are quoted:
III, 1, 4. ávardhayan su-bhágam saptá yahvî´h svetám gagñânám arushám mahi-tvâ´, sísum ná, gâtám abhí âruh ásvâh. Here, however, it is only said that Agni was born brilliant-white a, and grew red, that the horses came to him as they come to a new-born foal. Agni himself is not called a red-horse.
III, 7, 5. Here, again, vríshnah arushásya is no doubt meant for Agni. But vríshan by itself does not mean horse, though it is added to different names of horses to qualify them as male horses; cf. VII, 69, I, â´ vâm ráthah vríshabhih yâtu ásvaih, may your chariot come near with powerful horses, i. e. with stallions. See note to I, 85, 12. We are therefore not justified in translating arushá vríshan by red-horse, but only by the red male, or the red hero.
In III, 31, 3, agníh gagñe guhvẫ régamânah mahâ´h putrâ´n arushásya pra-yákshe, I do not venture to say who is meant by the maháh putrâ´n arushásya, whether Âdityas or Maruts, but hardly the sons of Agni, as Agni himself is mentioned as only born. But, even if it were so, the father of these sons (putra) could hardly be intended here for a horse.
IV, 6, 9. táva tyé agne harítah ghrita-snâ´h róhitâsah rigu-áñkah su-áñkah, arushâ´sah vríshanah rigu-mushkâ´h. Here, so far from Agni being represented as a red-horse, his different horses, the Haríts or bays, the Róhitas or

p. 26
ruddy, and the arushâ´sah vríshanah, the red stallions, are distinctly mentioned. Here vríshan may be translated by stallion, instead of simply by male, because arushá is here a substantive, the name of a horse.
V, 1, 5. gánishta hí gényah ágre áhnâm hitáh hitéshu arusháh váneshu. Here arusháh is simply an adjective, red, referring to Agni, who is understood throughout the hymn to be the object of praise. He is said to be kind to those who are kind to him, and to be red in the woods, i. e. brilliant in the wood which he consumes; cf. III, 29, 6. Nothing is said about his equine nature.
In V, 12, 2 and 6, VI, 48, 6, we have again simply arushá vríshan, which does not mean the red-horse, but the red male, the red hero, i. e. Agni.
In VI, 49, 2, diváh sísum sáhasah sûnúm agním yagñásya ketúm arushám yágadhyai, there is no trace of Agni being conceived as a horse. He is called the child of the sky or of Dyu, the son of strength (who is produced by strong rubbing of wood), the light or the beacon of the sacrifice, and lastly Arushá, which, for reasons stated above, I take to be used here as a name.
Next follow the passages in which, according to Professor Roth, arushá, as an adjective, is said to be applied to the horses, cows, and other teams of the gods, particularly of the dawn, the Asvins, and Brihaspati.
I, 118, 5. pári vâm ásvâh vápushah pataṅgâ´h váyah vahantu arushâ´h abhî´ke. Here we find the váyah arushâ´h of the Asvins, which it is better to translate by red birds, as immediately before the winged horses are mentioned. In fact, whenever arushá is applied to the vehicle of the Asvins, it is to be understood of these red birds, IV, 43, 6.
In I, 92, 1 and 2 (not 20), árushî occurs three times, referring twice to the cows of the dawn, once to the dawn herself.
In IV, 15, 6, tám árvantam ná sânasím arushám ná diváh sísum marmrigyánte divé-dive, arushá does not refer to the horse or any other animal of Agni. The verse speaks of a horse by way of comparison only, and says that the sacrificers clean or trim Agni, the fire, as people clean a horse. We
p. 27
cannot join arushám in the next pâda with árvantam in the preceding pâda, for the second ná would then be without any construction. The construction is certainly not easy, but I think it is safer to translate: they trim him (Agni), day by day, as they clean a strong horse, as they clean Arushá, the child of Dyu. In fact, as far as I know, arushá is never used as the name of the one single horse belonging to Agni, but always of two or more.
In III, 31, 21, antár (íti) krishnâ´n arushaíh dhâ´ma bhih gât, dhâ´ma bhih is said to mean flames of lightning. But dhâ´man in the Rig-veda does not mean flames, and it seems better to translate, with thy red companies, scil. the Maruts.
That arushá in one or two passages means the red cloud, is true. But in X, 43, 9, arushá refers to the thunderbolt mentioned in the same verse; and in I, 114, 5, everything refers to Rudra, and not to a red cloud,, in the proper sense of the word.
Further on, where the meanings attributable to árushî in the Veda are collected, it is said that árushî means a red mare, also the teams of Agni and Ushas. Now, here, surely, a distinction should have been made between those passages in which árushî means a real horse, and those where it expresses the imaginary steeds of Agni. The former, it should be observed, occur in one Mandala only, and in places of somewhat doubtful authority, in VIII, 55, 3, a Vâlakhilya hymn, and in VIII, 68, 18, a dânastuti or panegyric. Besides, no passage is given where árushî means the horses of the dawn, and I doubt whether such a passage exists, while the one verse where árushî is really used for the horses of Indra, is not mentioned at all. Lastly, two passages are set apart where árushî is supposed to mean flames. Now, it may be perfectly true that the red-horses of Agni are meant for flames, just as the red-horses of Indra may be the rays of the sun. But, in that case, the red-horses of Agni should always have been thus translated, or rather interpreted, and not in one passage only. In IX, 111, 2, árushî is said to mean flames, but no further light is thrown upon that very difficult passage.
p. 28
Note 2. Pári tasthúshah. I take this form as a nominative plural like ábibhyushah, I, 11, 5, tvâ´m devâ´h ábibhyushah tugyámânâsah âvishuh, 'the gods, stirred up, came to thee, not fearing;' and like dadúshah, I, 54, 8, yé te indra dadúshah vardháyanti máhi kshatrám, 'who giving or by their gifts increase thy great power, O Indra.' Here we might possibly take it as a gen. sing. referring to te, but dadivân is far more appropriate as an epithet of the sacrificer than of the god. (See Benfey, Vocativ, p. 24; and Hermes, p. 16.) It is well known among Sanskrit scholars that Professor Whitney, in reviewing my translation, declared that the participial form tasthushah had no right to be anything but an accusative plural or a genitive or ablative singular. (See Chips from a German Workshop, vol. iv, p. 508.) Dr. Kern, however, in his translation of the Brihat-Samhitâ had shown long before that nom. plur. such as vidushah are by no means rare, even in the Mahâbhârata and kindred works. Dr. Lanman (Journ. Americ. Or. Soc. X, p. 513) has now entered abibhyushah as a nom. plur., but he prefers to take tasthushah as an acc. plural, so that we should have to translate kárantam pári tasthúshah by 'walking round those who stand.' This may be grammatically possible; but who could be meant by tasthushah, standing ones? And, secondly, is it usual in Vedic Sanskrit to say karati pári tam, he walks round him?' We find pari tam yâti, or tam pari yâti, but hardly yâti pari tam, 'he goes round him,' except when pari stands independent of the verb and means 'around,' e. g. IX, 72, 8, pavasva pári pâ´rthivam rágah. It is more difficult to decide whether we should adopt Ludwig's interpretation, who takes pari tasthushah in the sense of 'away from what is firm.' This is correct grammatically, and tasthivat, as opposed to gágat, is often used in the sense of what is immovable. But is it ever used in that sense by itself? I doubt it, though I may add in support of it such a passage as I, 191, 9, út apaptat asaú sû´ryah … âdityáh párvatebhyah, a verse where the expression visvádrishtah adríshtahâ´ is analogous to our ketûm krinván aketáve. I therefore retain pari tasthushah as a nom. plural in the sense of standing around, circumstantes, possibly of parikara,
p. 29
attendants. Parishthâna or sthâna comes to mean an abode, and paritasthivantas would be bystanders, attendants, the people, in fact, who are supposed to harness the horse.
Though I do not assign great weight to interpretations of hymns, as given by the Brâhmanas, I may mention that in the Taitt. Br. III, 9, 4, I, paritasthushah is explained as a nom. plur., ime vai lokâh paritasthushah, while Sâyana in his commentary (Sâma-veda II, 6, 3, 12, i) has paritoऽvasthitâ lokatrayavartinah prâninah.
Note 3. Rókante rokanâ´. A similar expression occurs III, 61, 5, where it is said of Ushas, the dawn, that she lighted the lights in the sky, prá rokanâ´ ruruke ranvásandrik.
Verse 2.
Wilson: They (the charioteers) harness to his car his two desirable coursers, placed on either hand, bay-coloured, high-spirited, chief-bearing.
Benfey: Die lieben Falben schirren sie zu beiden Seiten des Wagens an, braune, kühne, held-tragende.
Ludwig: Sie spannen seine lieblichen falben an den wagen mit auseinandergehenden seiten, die blutroten, mutigen, helden-bringenden.
Note 1. Although no name is given, the pronoun asya clearly refers to Indra, for it is he to whom the two bays belong. The next verse, therefore, must likewise be taken as addressed to Indra, and not to the sun or the morning-red, spoken of as a horse or a chariot in the first verse.
Vipakshasâ is well explained by Sâyana, vividhe pakshasî rathasya pârsvau yayos tau vipakshasau, rathasya dvayoh pârsvayor yogitâv ity arthah. The only doubt is whether it refers to the two sides of the chariot, or of the principal horse. That horses were sometimes yoked so that one should act as leader, and two should be harnessed on each side, we see in I, 39, 6, note.
p. 30
Verse 3.
Wilson: Mortals, you owe your (daily) birth (to such an Indra), who, with the rays of the morning, gives sense to the senseless, and to the formless, form.
Benfey: Licht machend—Männer!—das Dunkele and kenntlich das Unkenntliche, entsprangst du mit dem Morgenroth.
Ludwig: Sichtbarkeit schaffend dem unsichtbaren, gestalt o schmuckreiche (Marut) dem gestaltlosen, wurdet ihr mit den Ushas zusammen geboren.
Note 1. In the TB. III, 9, 4, several of these mantras are enjoined for the Asvamedha. When the banner (dhvaga) is fastened, this verse is to be used, because ketu was supposed to mean a banner. The vocative maryâh, which I have translated by O men, had evidently become a mere exclamation at a very early time. Even in our passage it is clear that the poet does not address any men in particular, for he addresses Indra, nor is marya used in the general sense of men. It means males, or male offspring. It sounds more like some kind of asseveration or oath, like the Latin mehercle, or like the English O ye powers, and it is therefore quoted as a nipâta or particle in the Vâg. Prâtis. II, 16. It can hardly be taken here as addressed to the Maruts, though the Maruts are the subject of the next verse. Kluge in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xxv, p. 309, points out that maryâh as an interjection does not occur again in the Rig-veda. But the Rig-veda contains many words which occur once only, and the author of Vâg. Prâtisâkhya is no mean authority. See also Tândya Brâhm. VII, 6, 5. If Dr. Kluge proposes to read mâryâi as a dative (like λύκῳ) he knows, of course, that such a form does not only never occur again in the Rig-veda, but never in the whole of Sanskrit literature. Grassmann and Lanman (N. I., p. 339) both seem to imagine that the Pada text has marya, but it has maryâh, and no accent. If maryâh had the accent, we might possibly translate, 'the youths, i. e. the Maruts, made,' taking krinvan for akrinvan, or the more usual akurvan; but in that case the transition to agâyathâh would be very sudden. See, however, I, 6, 7.
p. 31
Sâyana explains it maryâh, manushyâh! idam âskaryam pasyata. Another explanation of this verse, which evidently troubled the ancient commentators as much as us, is, 'O mortal, i. e. O sun (dying daily), thou hast been born with the dawn.'
Note 2. Ushádbhih, an instrumental plural which attracted the attention of the author of the Vârttika to Pân. VII, 4, 48. It occurs but once, but the regular form, ushobhih, does not occur at all in the Rig-veda. The same grammarian mentions mâs, month, as changing the final s of its base into d before bhis. This, too, is confirmed by RV. II, 24, 5, where mâdbhíh occurs. Two other words, svavas, offering good protection, and svatavas, of independent strength, mentioned together as liable to the same change, do not occur with bhih in the Rig-veda, but the forms svavadbhih and svatavadbhih probably occurred in some other Vedic writings. Svatavadbhyah has been pointed out by Professor Aufrecht in the Vâgasan. Samhitâ XXIV, 16, and svatavobhyah in Satap. Br. II, 5, I, 14. That the nom. svavân, which is always trisyllabic, is not to be divided into sva-vân, as proposed by Sâkalya, but into su-avân, is implied by Vârttika to Pân. VIII, 4, 48, and distinctly stated in the Siddhânta-Kaumudî. That the final n of the nom. su-avân disappeared before semi-vowels is confirmed by the Sâkala-prâtisâkhya, Sûtra 287; see also Vâgasan. Prâtis. III, Sûtra 135 (Weber, Ind. Stud. vol. iv, p. 206). On the proper division of su-avas, see Aufrecht, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, vol. xiii, p. 499.
Verse 4.
Wilson: Thereafter, verily, those who bear names invoked in holy rites (the Maruts), having seen the rain about to be engendered, instigated him to resume his embryo condition (in the clouds).
Benfey: Sodann von freien Stücken gleich erregen wieder Schwangerschaft die heilgen Namen tragenden.
Ludwig: Da haben nämlich in ihrer göttlichen weise dise der Prisni leibesfrucht gebracht, opfer verdienenden namen erwerbend.
p. 32
Note 1. Ât must here take vyûha and be pronounced as an iambus. This is exceptional with ât, but there are at least two other passages where the same pronunciation is necessary. I, 148, 4, â´t rokate váne â´ vi-bhâ´-vâ, though in the line immediately following it is monosyllabic. Also in V, 7, 10, â´t agne áprinatah.
Note 2. Svadhâ´, literally one's own place, afterwards, one's own nature. It was a great triumph for the science of Comparative Philology that, long before the existence of such a word as svadhâ in Sanskrit was known, it should have been postulated by Professor Benfey in his Griechisches Wurzellexicon, published in 1839, and in the appendix of 1842. Svadhâ´ was known, it is true, in the ordinary Sanskrit, but there it only occurred as an exclamation used on presenting an oblation to the manes. It was also explained to mean food offered to deceased ancestors, or to be the name of a personification of Mâyâ or worldly illusion, or of a nymph. But Professor Benfey, with great ingenuity, postulated for Sanskrit a noun svadhâ´, as corresponding to the Greek ἔθος and the German sitte, O. H. G. sit-u, Gothic sid-u. The noun svadhâ has since been discovered in the Veda, where it occurs very frequently; and its true meaning in many passages where native tradition had entirely misunderstood it, has really been restored by means of its etymological identification with the Greek ἔθος or ἦθος. See Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. ii, p. 134; vol. xii, p. 158.
The expressions ánu svadhâ´m and svadhâ´m ánu are of frequent occurrence. They mean, according to the nature or character of the persons spoken of, and may be translated by as usual, or according to a person's wont. Thus in our passage we may translate, The Maruts are born again, i. e. as soon as Indra appeared with the dawn, according to their wont; they are always born as soon as Indra appears, for such is their nature.
I, 165, 5. índra svadhâ´m ánu hí nah babhû´tha.
For, Indra, according to thy wont, thou art with us.
VIII, 20, 7. svadhâ´m ánu sríyam nárah—váhante. According to their wont, the men (the Maruts) carry splendour.
p. 33
Thou hast grown (Indra) according to thy nature.
IV, 33, 6. ánu svadhâ´m ribhávah gagmuh etâ´m.
According to their nature, the Ribhus went to her, scil. the cow; or, according to this their nature, they came.
IV, 52, 6; I, 33, 11; I, 88, 6; VII, 56, 13; III, 51, 11.
In all these passages svadhâ´ may be rendered by manner, habit, usage, and ánu svadhâ´m would seem to correspond to the Greek ἐξ ἔθους. Yet the history of these words in Sanskrit and Greek has not been exactly the same. First of all we observe in Greek a division between ἔθος and ἦθος, and whereas the former comes very near in meaning to the Sanskrit svadhâ, the latter shows in Homer a much more primitive and material sense. It means in Homer, not a person's own nature, but the own place, for instance, of animals, the haunts of horses, lions, fish; in Hesiod, also of men. Hom. Il. XV, 268, μετά τ᾽ ἤθεα καὶ νομὸν ἵππων, loca consueta et pascua. Svadhâ´ in the Veda does not occur in that sense, although etymologically it might take the meaning of one's own place: cf. dhâ-man, familia, &c. Whether in Greek ἦθος, from meaning lair, haunt, home, came, like νομός and νόμος, to mean habit, manner, character, which would be quite possible, or whether ἦθος in that meaning represents a second start from the same point, which in Sanskrit was fixed in svadhâ´, is impossible to determine. In Sanskrit svadhâ´ clearly shows the meaning of one's own nature, power, disposition. It does not mean power or nature in general, but always the power of some one, the peculiarity, the individuality of a person. This will appear from the following passages:
II, 3, 8. tisráh devî´k svadháyâ barhíh â´ idám ákkhidram pântu.
May the three goddesses protect by their power the sacred pile unbroken.
IV, 13, 5. káyâ yâti svadháyâ.
By what inherent power does he (the Sun) move on?
IV, 26, 4. akakráyâ svadháyâ.
By a power which requires no chariot, i. e. by himself without a chariot.
The same expression occurs again X, 27, 19.
p. 34
In some places the verb mad, to delight, joined with svadháyâ, seems to mean to revel in his strength, to be proud of his might.
V, 32, 4. svadháyâ mádantam.
Vritra who delights in his strength.
VII, 47, 3. svadháyâ mádantîh.
The waters who delight in their strength. See X, 124, 8.
In other passages, however, as we shall see, the same phrase (and this is rather unusual) requires to be taken in a different sense, so as to mean to rejoice in food.
I, 164, 38; III, 17, 5.
III, 35, 10. índra píba svadháyâ kit sutásya agnéh vâ pâhi gihváyâ yagatra.
Indra drink of the libation by thyself (by thy own power), or with the tongue of Agni, O worshipful.
To drink with the tongue of Agni is a bold but not unusual expression. V, 51, 2. agnéh pibata gihváyâ. X, 15, 3.
I, 165, 6. kvâ´ syâ´ vah marutah svadhâ´ âsît yát mâ´m ékam sam-ádhatta ahi-hátye.
Where was that custom of yours, O Maruts, when you left me alone in the killing of Ahi?
VII, 8, 3. káyâ nah agne ví vasah su-vriktím kâ´m ûm (íti) svadhâ´m rinavah sasyámânah.
In what character dost thou light up our work, and what character dost thou assume, when thou art praised?
IV, 58, 4; IV, 45, 6.
I, 64, 4. sâkám gagñire svadháyâ.
They (the Maruts) were born together, according to their nature; very much like ánu svadhâ´m, I, 6, 4. One can hardly render it here by 'they were born by their own strength,' or 'by spontaneous generation.'
In other passages, however, svadháyâ, meaning originally by its own power, or nature, comes to mean, by itself, sponte suâ.
VII, 78, 4. â´ asthât rátham svadháyâ yugyámânam.
She, the dawn, mounted the chariot which was harnessed by itself, by its own power, without requiring the assistance of people to put the horses to.
p. 35
X, 129, 2. â´nît avâtám svadháyâ tát ékam.
That only One breathed breathlessly (or freely) by its own strength, i. e. by itself.
In the same sense svadhâ´bhih is used in several passages: I, 113, 13. amrítâ karati svadhâ´bhih.
The immortal Dawn moves along by her own strength, i. e. by herself.
VIII, 10, 6. yát vâ svadhâ´bhih adhi-tíshthathah rátham.
Or whether ye mount your chariot by your own strength, ye Asvins.
I, 164, 30. gîváh mritásya karati svadhâ´bhih ámartyah mártyena sá-yonih.
The living moves by the powers of the dead, the immortal is the brother of the mortal. III, 26, 8; V, 60, 4.
There are doubtful passages, such as I, 180, 6, in which the meaning of svadhâ´bhih, too, is doubtful. In VI, 2, 8, svadhâ´ looks like an adverb, instead of svadháyâ, and would then refer to párigmâ. The same applies to VIII, 32, 6.
But svadhâ´ means also food, lit. one's own portion, the sacrificial offering due to each god, and lastly, food in general.
I, 108, 12. yát indrâgnî (íti) út-itâ sû´ryasya mádhye diváh svadháyâ mâdáyethe (íti).
Whether you, Indra and Agni, delight in your food at the rising of the sun or at midday.
X, 15, 12. tvám agne îlitáh gâta-vedah ávât havyâ´ni surabhî´ni kritvî´, prá adâh pitrí-bhyah svadháyâ té akshan addhí tvám deva prá-yatâ havî´mshi. 13. yé ka ihá pitárah yé ka ná ihá yâ´n ka vidmá yâ´n ûm (íti) ka ná pra-vidmâ, tvám vettha yáti té gâta-vedah svadhâ´bhih yagñám súkritam gushasva. 14. yé agni-dagdhâ´h yé ánagni-dagdhâh mádhye diváh svadháyâ mâdáyante, tébhih sva-râ´t ásunîtim etâ´m yathâ-vasám tanvâ´m kalpayasva.
12. Thou, O Agni Gâtavedas, hast carried, when implored, the offerings which thou hast rendered sweet: thou hast given them to the fathers, they fed on their share. Eat thou, O god, the proffered oblations. 13. Our fathers who are here, and those who are not here, our fathers whom we know and those whom we do not know, thou knowest
p. 36
how many they are, O Gâtavedas, accept the well-made sacrifice with the sacrificial portions. 14. They who, whether burnt by fire or not burnt by fire, rejoice in their offering in the midst of heaven, give to them, O king, that life, and thy (their) own body, according to thy will.
III, 4, 7. saptá prikshâ´sah svadháyâ madanti.
The seven horses delight in their food.
X, 14, 7. ubhâ´ râ´gânâ svadháyâ mádantâ.
The two kings delighting in their food.
IX, 113, 10. yátra kâ´mâh ni-kâmâ´h ka, yátra bradhnâsya vishtápam, svadhâ´ ka yátra tríptih ka tátra mâ´m amrítam kridhí.
Where wishes and desires are, where the cup of the bright Soma is (or, where the highest place of the sun is), where there is food and rejoicing, there make me immortal.
I, 154, 4. yásya trî´ pûrnâ´ mádhunâ padâ´ni ákshîyamânâ svadháyâ mádanti.
He (Vishnu) whose three places, full of sweet, imperishable, delight or abound in food.
V, 34, 1; II, 35, 7; I, 168, 9; I, 176, 2.
In the tenth book svadhâ is used very much as it occurs in the later Sanskrit, as the name of a peculiar sacrificial rite.
X, 14, 3. yâ´n ka devâ´h vavridhúh yé ka devâ´n svâ´hâ anyé svadháyâ anyé madanti.
Those whom the gods cherish, and those who cherish the gods, the one delight in Svâhâ, the others in Svadhâ; or, in praise and food.
Note 3. The expression garbha-tvám â-îrire is matched by that of III, 60, 3, saudhanvanâ´sah amrita-tvám â´ îrire, the Saudhanvanas (the Ribhus) obtained immortality, or became immortal. I do not think that punar erire can mean, as Ludwig supposes, they pushed away their state of garbha. The idea that the Maruts assumed the form of a garbha, lit. of an embryo or a new-born child, is only meant to express that they were born, or that the storms burst forth from the womb of the sky as soon as Indra arises to do battle against the demon of darkness. Thus we read, I, 134, 4, áganayah marútah vakshánâbhyah, Thou, Vâyu, hast produced the Maruts from the bowels (of the sky).
p. 37
[paragraph continues]
As assisting Indra in this battle, the Maruts, whose name retained for a long time its purely appellative meaning of storms, attained their rank as deities by the side of Indra, or, as the poet expresses it, they assumed their sacred name. This seems to be the whole meaning of the later legend that the Maruts, like the Ribhus, were not originally gods, but became deified for their works. See also Kern, Translation of Brihat-samhitâ, p. 117, note.
Other explanations are: they made that which was born within the cloud into a garbha or embryo; or, they arose with Âditya, proceeded with Savitar, and when Savitar set, they became again garbhas; see Sâma-veda II, 2, 7, 2, comm.
Váhni.
Verse 5.
Wilson: Associated with the conveying Maruts, the traversers of places difficult of access, thou, Indra, hast discovered the cows hidden in the cave.
Benfey: Mit den die Festen brechenden, den Stû´rmenden fandst, Indra, du die Kû´he in der Grotte gar.
Ludwig: Und mit denen, die das feste sogar anbrechen, selbst im versteck, o Indra, mit den priesterlichen, fandest du die morgenstralen auf.
Note 1. Sâyana explains váhnibhih in the sense of Marúdbhih, and he tells the oft-repeated story how the cows were carried off by the Panis from the world of the gods, and thrown into darkness, and how Indra with the Maruts conquered them and brought them back. Everybody seems to have accepted this explanation of Sâyana, and I myself do not venture to depart from it. Yet it should be stated that the use of váhni as a name of the Maruts is by no means well established. Váhni is in fact a most difficult word in the Veda. In later Sanskrit it means fire, and is quoted also as a name of Agni, the god of fire, but we do not learn why a word which etymologically means carrier, from vah, to carry, should have assumed the meaning of fire. It may be that vah, which in Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin means chiefly to carry, expressed originally
p. 38
the idea of moving about (the German be-wegen), in which case váh-ni, fire, would have been formed with the same purpose as ag-ní, ig-nis, fire, from Sk. ag, ἀγ-ω, ag-o. In Alvis-mal, V, 94, we read, kalla Vág Vanir, the Wanes call fire Vág, i. e. wavy. But in Sanskrit Agni is so constantly represented as the carrier of the sacrificial oblation, that something may also be said in favour of the Indian scholastic interpreters who take váhni, as applied to Agni, in the sense of carrier. However that may be, it admits of no doubt that váhni, in the Veda, is distinctly applied to the bright fire or light. In some passages it looks very much like a proper name of Agni, in his various characters of terrestrial and celestial light. It is used for the sacrificial fire:
V, 50, 4. yátra váhnih abhí-hitah.
Where the sacrificial fire is placed.
It is applied to Agni:
VII, 7, 5. ásâdi vritáh váhnih â-gaganvâ´n agníh brahmâ´.
The chosen light came nigh, and sat down, Agni, the priest.
Here Agni is, as usual, represented as a priest, chosen like a priest, for the performance of the sacrifice. But, for that very reason, váhni may here have the meaning of priest, which, as we shall see, it has in many places, and the translation would then be more natural: He, the chosen minister, came near and sat down, Agni, the priest.
VIII, 23, 3. váhnih vindate vásu.
Agni finds wealth (for those who offer sacrifices?).
More frequently váhni is applied to the celestial Agni, or other solar deities, where it is difficult to translate it in English except by an adjective:
III, 5,i. ápa dvâ´râ támasah váhnih âvar (íty âvah).
Agni opened the two doors of darkness.
I, 160, 3. sáh váhnih putráh pitróh pavítra-vân punâ´ti dhî´rah bhúvanâni mâyáyâ.
That light, the son of the two parents, full of brightness, the wise, brightens the world by his power.
Agni is even called váhni-tama (IV, I, 4), which hardly means more than the brightest.
p. 39
II, 17, 4. â´t ródasî (íti) gyótishâ váhnih â´ atanot.
Then the bright (Indra) stretched out or filled heaven and earth with his light.
II, 38, I. út ûm (íti) syáh deváh savitâ´—váhnih asthât. The divine Savitar, the luminous, arose.
Besides this meaning of light or fire, however, there are clearly two other meanings of váhni which must be admitted in the Veda, first that of a carrier, vehicle, and, it may be, horse; secondly that of minister or priest.
VI, 57, 3. agâ´h anyásya váhnayah hárî (íti) anyásya sámbhritâ.
The bearers of the one (Pûshan) are goats, the bays are yoked for the other (Indra).
I, 14, 6. ghritá-prishthâh manah-yúgah yé tvâ váhanti váhnayah.
The horses with shining backs, obedient to thy will, which carry thee (Agni).
VIII, 3, 23. yásmai anyé dása práti dhúram váhanti váhnayah.
A horse against whom other ten horses carry a weight; i. e. it requires ten horses to carry the weight which this one horse carries. (See X, II, 7. váhamânah ásvaih.)
II, 37, 3. médyantu te váhnayah yébhih î´yase.
May thy horses be fat on which thou goest. II, 24, 13.
I, 44, 13. srudhí srut-karna váhni-bhih.
Agni, who hast ears to hear, hear, on thy horses. Unless váhni-bhih is joined with the words that follow, devaíh sayâ´va-bhih.
III, 6, 2. vakyántâm te vâhnayah saptá-gihvâh a.
May thy seven-tongued horses be called. Here váhnayah is clearly meant for the flames of Agni, yet I doubt whether we should be justified in dropping the simile, as the plural of váhni is nowhere used in the bald sense of flames.
In one passage váhni is supposed to be used as a feminine, or at all events applied to a feminine subject:
VIII, 94, 1. yuktâ´ váhnih ráthânâm.

p. 40
She is yoked as the drawer of the chariots. Probably, however, váhnih should here be changed into váhnî.
The passages in which váhni is applied to Soma in the ninth and tenth Mandalas throw little light on the subject. (IX, 9, 6; 20, 5; 6; 36, 2; 64, 19; 89, 1; X, 101, 10.)
Instead of visâ´m vispátih, lord of men (VII, 7, 4), we find IX, 108, 10. visâ´m váhnih ná vispátih. One feels inclined to translate here váhnih by leader, but it is more likely that váhni is here again the common name of Soma, and that it is inserted between visâ´m ná vispátih, which is meant to form one phrase.
In IX, 97, 34, tisráh vâ´kah îrayati prá váhnih, we may take váhni as the common appellation of Soma. But it may also mean minister or priest, as in the passages which we have now to examine. Cf. X, 11, 6.
For besides these passages in which váhni clearly means vector, carrier, drawer, horse, there is a large class of verses in which it can only be translated by minister, i. e. officiating minister, and, as it would seem, chiefly singer or reciter a.
The verb vah was used in Sanskrit in the sense of carrying out (ud-vah, ausführen), or performing a rite, particularly as applied to the reciting of hymns. Hence such compounds as ukthá-vâhas or stoma-vâhas, offering hymns of praise, and yagñá-vâhas. Thus we read
V, 79, 4. abhí yé tvâ vibhâ-vari stómaih grinánti váhnayah.
The ministers who praise thee, splendid Dawn, with hymns.
I, 48, 11, yé tvâ grinánti váhnayah.
The ministers who praise thee.
VII, 75, 5. ushâ´h ukkhati váhni-bhih grinânâ´.
The dawn lights up, praised by the ministers.
VI, 39, 1. mandrásya kavéh divyásya váhneh.
Of the sweet poet, of the heavenly priest …
VII, 82, 4. yuvâ´m ít yut-sú prítanâsu váhnayah yuvâ´m kshémasya pra-savé mitá-gñavah, îsânâ´ vásvah ubháyasya kârávah índrâvarunâ su-hávâ havâmahe.

p. 41
We, as ministers, invoke you only in fights and battles; we, as suppliants, (invoke) you for the granting of treasure; we, as poets, (invoke) you, the lords of twofold wealth, you, Indra and Varuna, who listen to our call.
VI, 32, 3. sáh váhni-bhih ríkva-bhih góshu sásvat mitágñu-bhih puru-krítvâ gigâya.
He (Indra) was victorious often among the cows, always with celebrating and suppliant ministers.
I have placed these two passages together because they seem to me to illustrate each other, and to show that although in the second passage the celebrating and suppliant ministers may be intended for the Maruts, yet no argument could be drawn from this verse in favour of váhni by itself meaning the Maruts. See also VIII, 6, 2; 12, 15; X, 114, 2.
IV, 21, 6. hótâ yáh nah mahâ´n sam-váraneshu váhnih.
The Hotar who is our great priest in the sanctuaries.
I, 128, 4. váhnih vedhâ´h ágâyata.
Because the wise priest (Agni) was born.
The same name which in these passages is applied to Agni, is in others, and, as it will be seen, in the same sense, applied to Indra.
II, 21, 2. tuvi-gráye váhnaye.
To the strong-voiced priest or leader.
The fact that váhni is followed in several passages by ukthaíh would seem to show that the office of the váhni was chiefly that of recitation or of addressing prayers to the gods.
III, 20, 1. agním ushásam asvínâ dadhi-krâ´m ví-ushtishu havate váhnih ukthaíh.
The priest at the break of day calls with his hymns Agni, Ushas, the Asvins, and Dadhikrâ.
I, 184, 1. tâ´ vâm adyá taú aparám huvema ukkhántyâm ushási váhnih ukthaíh.
Let us invoke the two Asvins to-day and to-morrow, the priest with his hymns is there when the dawn appears.
In a similar sense, it would seem, as váhnih ukthaíh, the Vedic poets frequently use the words váhnih âsâ´. This âsâ´ is the instrumental singular of âs, mouth, and it is used
p. 42
in other phrases also of the mouth as the instrument of praise.
VI, 32, 1. vagríne sám-tamâni vákâmsi âsâ´ sthávirâya taksham.
I have shaped with my mouth blessed words to the wielder of the thunderbolt, the strong Indra.
X, 115, 3. âsâ´ váhnim ná sokíshâ vi-rapsínam.
He who sings with his flame as the poet with his mouth. See also I, 38, 14. mimîhí slókam âsyẽ, make a song in thy mouth.
Thus we find váhnih âsâ´ in the same place in the sixth and seventh Mandalas (VI, 16, 9; VII, 16, 9), in the phrase váhnih âsâ´ vidúh-tarah, applied to Agni in the sense of the priest wise with his mouth, or taking váhnih âsâ´ as it were one word, the wise poet.
I, 129, 5. váhnih âsâ´, váhnih nah ákkha.
Indra, as a priest by his lips, as a priest coming towards us.
From the parallelism of this passage it would seem that Professor Roth concluded the meaning of âsâ´ a to be near,

p. 43
or coram. In the Nighantu, II, 16, the right reading is evidently âsât, not âsâ; see Nirukta, ed. Satyavrata Sâmasrami, vol. i, p. 264. Âsâ´, however, is an old variant, as may be seen from Rig-veda-bhâshya I, 127, 8; X, 115, 3.
I, 76, 4. pragâ´-vatâ vákasâ váhnih âsâ´ â´ ka huvé ní ka satsi ihá devaíh.
With words in which my people join, I, the poet, invoke, and thou (Agni) sittest down with the gods.
VI, 11, 2. pâvakáyâ guhvẫ váhnih âsâ´.
Thou, a poet with a bright tongue, O Agni!
Grassmann thinks that vahnir âsâ can always be translated by 'vor das Angesicht bringend,' but this does not appear to be the case in his translation.
The question now arises in what sense váhni is used when applied without further definition to certain deities. Most deities in the Veda are represented as driving or driven, and many as poets or priests. When the Asvins are called váhnî, VIII, 8, 12; VII, 73, 4, it may mean riders. But when the Visve Devâs are so called, I, 3, 9, or the Ribhus, the exact meaning is more doubtful. The Maruts are certainly riders, and whatever other scholars may say to the contrary, it can be proved that they were supposed to sit astride on horseback, and to have the bridle through the horse's nostrils (V, 61, 2). But if in our verse I, 6, 5, we translate váhni as an epithet, rider, and not only as an epithet, but as a name of the Maruts, we cannot support our translation by independent evidence, but must rely partly on the authority of Sâyana, partly on the general tenor of the text before us, where the Maruts are mentioned in the preceding verse, and, if I am right, in the verse following also. On the other hand, if váhni can thus be used as a name of
p. 44
the Maruts, there is at least one other passage which would gain in clearness by the admission of that meaning, viz.
X, 138, 1. táva tyé indra sakhyéshu váhnayah—ví adardiruh valám.
In thy friendship, Indra, these Maruts tore asunder the cloud.
Note 2. I have translated vîlú by stronghold, though it is only an adjective, meaning firm. Dr. Oscar Meyer, in his able essay Quaestiones Homericae, specimen prius, Bonnae, 1867, has tried to show that this vîlú is the original form of Ἴλιος, and he has brought some further evidence to show that the siege and conquest of Troy, as I pointed out in my Lectures on the Science of Language, vol. ii, p. 470, was originally described in language borrowed from the siege and conquest of the dark night by the powers of light, or from the destruction of the cloud by the weapons of Indra. It ought to be considered, however, that vîlú in the Veda has not dwindled down as yet to a mere name, and that therefore it may have originally retained its purely appellative power in Greek as well as in Sanskrit, and from meaning a stronghold in general, have come to mean the stronghold of Troy.
Note 3. The bright cows are here the cows of the morning, the dawns, or the days themselves, which are represented as rescued at the end of each night by the power of Indra, or similar solar gods. Indra's companions in that daily rescue are here the Maruts, the storms, the same companions who act even a more prominent part in the battle of Indra against the dark clouds. These two battles are often mixed up together, so that possibly usríyâh may have been meant for clouds.
Verse 6.
Wilson: The reciters of praises praise the mighty (troop of Maruts), who are celebrated, and conscious of the power of bestowing wealth in like manner as they (glorify) the counsellor (Indra).
Benfey: Nach ihrer Einsicht verherrlichend besingen Sänger den Schätzeherrn, den berühmten, gewaltigen.
p. 45
Ludwig: Als fromme heran zum liede haben die sänger ihn, der trefliches findet, berühmten gesungen.
Note 1. The reasons why I take gírah as a masculine in the sense of singer or praiser, may be seen in a note to I, 37, 10.
Note 2. yáthâ matím, lit. according to their mind, according to their heart's desire. Cf. II, 24, 13.
Verse 7.
Wilson: May you be seen, Maruts, accompanied by the undaunted (Indra); both rejoicing, and of equal splendour.
Benfey: So lass mit Indra denn vereint, dem furchtlosen, erblicken dich, beide erfreu’nd und glanzesgleich.
Ludwig: Mit Indra zusammen wirst du gesehn zusammengehend mit dem furchtlosen, mild ihr zwei, von gleichem glanze.
Note 1. The sudden transition from the plural to the singular is strange, but the host of the Maruts is frequently spoken of in the singular, and nothing else can here be intended. It may be true, as Professor Benfey suggests, that the verses here put together stood originally in a different order, or that they were taken from different sources. Yet though the Sâma-veda would seem to sanction a small alteration in the order of the verses, the alteration of verses 7, 4, 5, as following each other, would not help us much. The Atharva-veda sanctions no change in the order of these verses.
The transition to the dual at the end of the verse is likewise abrupt, not more so, however, than we are prepared for in the Veda. The suggestion of the Nirukta (IV, 12) that these duals might be taken as instrumentals of the singular, is of no real value.
Note 2. Dríkshase, a very valuable form, well explained by drisyethâh, a second person singular conjunctive of the First Aorist Âtmanepada, the termination 'sase' corresponding to Greek σῃ, as the conjunctive takes the personal terminations of the present in both languages. Similar
p. 46
forms, viz. prikshase, X, 22, 7, mamsase, X, 27, 10; Ath. Veda VII, 20, 2-6, and possibly vívakshase, X, 21, 1-8, 24, 1-3, 25, 1-11, will have to be considered hereafter. (Nirukta, ed. Roth, p. 30, Notes.) As Ludwig has pointed out, the Tândya-brâhmana XII, 2, 6, 7, reads drikshuse, and explains it by ime lokâ dadrisire. Sâyana, however, explains drisidhâtoh karmani madhyamaikavakane vyatyayena sepratyaye drikshusa iti rûpam. See Delbrück, Syntaktische Forschungen, I, p. 111. The story of Indra's being forsaken by all the gods in his battle against Vritra, but being helped by the Maruts, is often mentioned; see RV. VIII, 96, 7; SV. I, 4, 1, 4, 2; Ait. Br. III, 20.
Verse 8.
Wilson: This rite is performed in adoration of the powerful Indra, along with the irreproachable, heavenward-tending, and amiable bands (of the Maruts).
Benfey: Durch Indra's liebe Schaaren, die untadligen, himmelstürmenden, strahlet das Opfer mächtiglich.
Ludwig: Mit den tadellosen, morgens erscheinenden singt der kämpfer sighaft, mit des Indra zu liebenden scharen.
Note 1. Arkati, which I have here translated by he cries aloud, means literally, he celebrates. I do not know of any passage where arkati, when used, as here, without an object, means to shine, as Professor Benfey translates it. The real difficulty, however, lies in makhá, which Sâyana explains by sacrifice, and which I have ventured to translate by priest or sacrificer. Makhá, as an adjective, means, as far as we can judge, strong or vigorous, and is applied to various deities, such as Pûshan I, 138, 1, Savitri VI, 71, 1, Soma XI, 20, 7, Indra III, 34, 2, the Maruts I, 64, 11; VI, 66, 9. By itself, makhá is never used as the name of any deity, and it cannot therefore, as Professor Roth proposes, be used in our passage as a name of Indra, or be referred to Indra as a significant adjective. In I, 119, 3, makhá is applied to men or warriors, but it does not follow that makhá by itself means warriors, though it maybe connected
p. 47
with the Greek μαχος in σύμμαχος. See Curtius, Grundzüge, p. 293; Grassmann, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xvi, p. 164.
There are two passages where makhá refers to an enemy of the gods, IX, 101, 13; X, 171, 2.
Among the remaining passages there is one where makhá is used in parallelism with váhni, X, 11, 6. vívakti váhnih, su-apasyáte makháh. Here I propose to translate, The poet speaks out, the priest works well. The same meaning seems applicable likewise to the phrase makhásya dâváne, to the offering of the priest, though I should prefer to translate 'to share in the sacrifice.'
I, 134, 1. â´ yâhi dâváne, vâ´yo (íti), makhásya dâváne.
Come, Vâyu, to the offering, to the offering of the priest.
VIII, 7, 27. â´ nah makhásya dâváne—dévâsah ûpa gantana.
Come, gods, to the offering of our priest.
Professor Roth proposes to render makhá in these passages by 'attestation of joy, celebration, praise,' and he takes dâváne as a dative of dâván, a nomen actionis, meaning, the giving. There are some passages where one feels inclined to admit a noun dâvána, and to take dâváne as a locative sing.
VI, 71, 2. devásya vayám savitûh sávîmani
           sréshthe syâma vásunah ka dâváne.
May we be in the favour of the god Savitar, and in the best award of his treasure.
In II, 11, 1, and II, 11, 12, the locative would likewise be preferable; but there is a decided majority of passages in which dâváne occurs and where it is to be taken as a dative a, nor is there any other instance in the Veda of a nomen actionis being formed by vana. It is better, therefore, in VI, 71, 2, to refer sréshthe to sávîmani, and to make allowance in the other passages for the idiomatic use of such phrases as dâváne vásûnâm or râyáh dâváne, whether from dâ or from do. See De Infinitivi forma et usu, by E. Wilhelm, 1873, p. 17.

p. 48
The termination váne explains, as has been shown by Professor Benfey, Greek infinitives such as δοῦναι, i. e. δοεναι or δοϝεναι = Sanskrit dâ-váne. The termination mane in dâ´-mane, for the purpose of giving, explains, as the same scholar has proved, the ancient infinitives in Greek, such as δό-μεναι. It may be added that the regular infinitives in Greek, ending in εναι, as λελοιπ-έναι, are likewise matched by Vedic forms such as IX, 61, 30. dhû´rv-ane, or VI, 61, 13. vibhv-áne, and turv-áne (Delbrück in K. Z. XVIII, p. 82; Bopp, Accent, §§106, 113, 117). It is hardly right to say that vibhváne in VI, 61, 13, should be taken as an instrumental, for it does not refer to the chariot, but to Sarasvatî. In the termination ειν, which stands for ενι, like εις for εσι, we have, on the contrary, not a dative, but a locative of an abstract noun in an, both cases, as we see from their juxta-position in VI, 71, 2, being equally applicable to express the relation which we are accustomed to call infinitive. See RV. I, 134, 5. ugrâ´h ishananta bhurváni, apâ´m ishanta bhurváni.
Note 2. Abhidyu I now translate by hastening, and derive it from div, dîvyati, in its original meaning of to throw forth, to break forth, to shine. As from this root we have didyú, weapon, what is thrown, pl. didyavah, and possibly didyut, the weapon, particularly Indra's weapon or thunderbolt, abhídyu might mean breaking forth, rushing forth towards us, something like prakrîlínah, another name of the Maruts. How abhídyu could mean conquérant, maître du jour, as M. Bergaigne maintains, I do not see. Abhídyû´n, I, 33, I I; 190, 4, does not differ much from ánudyû´n, i. e. it is used vîpsâyâm.
Verses 9, 10.
Wilson: Therefore circumambient (troop of Maruts), come hither, whether from the region of the sky, or from the solar sphere; for, in this rite, (the priest) fully recites your praises.
Benfey: Von hier, oder vom Himmel komm ob dem Æther, Umkreisender! zu dir streben die Lieder all.
p. 49
Ludwig: Von hieher, o Parigman, kom, oder von des himels glanzfirmamente her; zu disem streben unsere lieder auf.
Wilson: We invoke Indra,—whether he come from this earthly region, or from the heaven above, or from the vast firmament,—that he may give (us) wealth.
Benfey: Von hier, oder vom Himmel ob der Erde begehren Spende wir, oder, Indra! aus weiter Luft.
Ludwig: Von hier zu empfangen verlangen wir, oder vom himel, oder vom irdischen raume her, oder aus dem grossen luftkreis den Indra.
Note 1. Although the names for earth, sky, and heaven vary in different parts of the Veda, yet the expression diváh rokanám occurs so frequently that we can hardly take it in this place in a sense different from its ordinary meaning. Professor Benfey thinks that rokaná may here mean ether, and he translates 'come from heaven above the ether;' and in the next verse, 'come from heaven above the earth.' At first, every reader would feel inclined to take the two phrases, diváh vâ rokanâ´t ádhi, and diváh vâ pâ´rthivât ádhi, as parallel; yet I believe they are not quite so.
The following passages will show that the two words rokanám diváh belong together, and that they signify the light of heaven, or the bright place of heaven.
VIII, 98, 3. ágakkhah rokanám diváh.
Thou (Indra) wentest to the light of heaven. I, 155, 3.
III, 6, 8. uraú vâ yé antárikshe—diváh vâ yé rokané.
In the wide sky, or in the light of heaven.
VIII, 82, 4. upamé rokané diváh.
In the highest light of heaven.
IX, 86, 27. tritî´ye prishthé ádhi rokané diváh.
On the third ridge, in the light of heaven. See also I, 105, 5; VIII, 69, 3.
The very phrase which we find in our verse, only with kit instead of vâ, occurs again, I, 49, I; VIII, 8, 7; and the same sense must probably be assigned to VIII, 1, 18, ádha gmáh ádha vâ divâh brihatáh rokanâ´t ádhi.
p. 50
Either from the earth, or from the light of the great heaven, increase, O Indra!
Rokaná also occurs in the plural:
I, 146, 1. vísvâ diváh rokanâ´.
All the bright regions of heaven.
Sâyana: 'All the bright palaces of the gods.' See III, 12, 9.
The same word rokaná, and in the same sense, is sometimes joined with sû´rya and nâ´ka.
Thus, I, 14, 9. sû´ryasya rokanâ´t vísvân devâ´n—hótâ ihá vakshati.
May the Hotar bring the Visve Devas hither from the light of the sun, or from the bright realm of the sun.
III, 22, 3. yâ´h rokané parástât sû´ryasya.
The waters which are above, in the bright realm of the sun, and those which are below.
I, 19, 6. yé nâ´kasya ádhi rokané, diví devâ´sah â´sate.
They who in the light of the firmament, in heaven, are enthroned as gods.
Here diví, in heaven, seems to be the same as the light of the firmament, nâ´kasya rokané.
Thus rokaná occurs also frequently by itself, when it clearly has the meaning of heaven.
It is said of the dawn, I, 49, 4; of the sun, I, 50, 4; and of Indra, III, 44, 4.
vísvam â´ bhâti rokanám, he lights up the whole sky.
We also read of three rokanas, where, though it is difficult to say what is really meant, we must translate, the three skies. The cosmography of the Veda is, as I said before, somewhat vague and varying. There is, of course, the natural division of the world into heaven and earth (dyú and bhû´mi), and the threefold division into earth, sky, and heaven, where sky is meant for the region intermediate between heaven and earth (prithivî´, antáriksha, dyú). There is also a fourfold division, for instance,
VIII, 97, 5.


p. 51
Whether thou, O greatest killer of Vritra, art in the light of heaven, or in the basin of the sea, or in the place of the earth, or in the sky, come hither!
V, 52, 7. yé vavridhánta pâ´rthivâh yé uraú antárikshe â´, vrigáne vâ nadî´nâm sadhá-sthe vâ maháh diváh.
The Maruts who grew, being on the earth, those who are in the wide sky, or in the realm of the rivers, or in the abode of the great heaven.
But very soon these three or more regions are each spoken of as threefold. Thus,
I, 102, 8. tisráh bhû´mîh trî´ni rokanâ´.
The three earths, the three skies.
II, 27, 9. trî´ rokanâ´ divyâ´ dhârayanta.
The Âdityas support the three heavenly skies.
V, 69, 1. trî´ rokanâ´ varuna trî´n utá dyû´n trî´ni mitra dhârayathah rágâmsi.
Mitra and Varuna, you support the three lights, and the three heavens, and the three skies.
Here there seems some confusion, which Sâyana's commentary makes even worse confounded. What can rokanâ´ mean as distinct from dyú and rágas? The fourth verse of the same hymn throws no light on the subject, and I should feel inclined to take divyâ´-pâ´rthivasya as one word, though even then the cosmic division here adopted is by no means clear. However, there is a still more complicated division alluded to in IV, 53, 5:
tríh antáriksham savitâ´ mahi-tvanâ´ trî´ rágâmsi pari-bhûh trî´ni rokanâ´, tisráh dívah prithivî´h tisráh invati.
Here we have the sky thrice, three welkins, three lights, three heavens, three earths.
A careful consideration of all these passages will show, I think, that in our passage we must take diváh vâ rokanâ´t ádhi in its usual sense, and that we cannot separate the two words.
In the next verse, on the contrary, it seems equally clear that diváh and pâ´rthivât must be separated. At all events there is no passage in the Rig-veda where pâ´rthiva is joined as an adjective with dyú. Pâ´rthiva as an adjective is frequently joined with rágas, never with dyú. See I, 81,
p. 52
[paragraph continues]
5; 99, 7; VIII, 88, 5; IX, 72, 8: in the plural, I, 154, 1; V, 81, 3; VI, 31, 2; 49, 3.
Pâ´rthivâni also occurs by itself, when it refers to the earth. as opposed to the sky and heaven.
X, 32, 2. ví indra yâsi divyâ´ni rokanâ´ ví pâ´rthivâni rágasâ.
Indra thou goest in the sky between the heavenly lights and the earthly.
VIII, 94, 9. â´ yé vísvâ pâ´rthivâni papráthan rokanâ´ diváh.
The Maruts who stretched out all the earthly lights, and the lights of heaven.
VI, 61, 11. â-paprúshî pâ´rthivâni urú rágah antáriksham.
Sarasvatî filling the earthly places, the wide welkin, the sky. This is a doubtful passage.
Lastly, pâ´rthivâni by itself seems to signify earth, sky, and heaven, if those are the three regions which Vishnu measured with his three steps; or east, the zenith, and west, if these were intended as the three steps of that deity. For we read:
I, 155, 4. yáh pâ´rthivâni tri-bhíh ít vígâma-bhih urú krámishta.
He (Vishnu) who strode wide with his three strides across the regions of the earth.
These two concluding verses might also be taken as containing the actual invocation of the sacrificer, which is mentioned in verse 8. In that case the full stop at the end of verse 8 should be removed.
"
6,"MANDALA I, HYMN 19.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 36-37.",.,"1. Thou art called forth to this fair sacrifice for a draught of milk 1; with the Maruts come hither, O Agni!
2. No god indeed, no mortal, is beyond the might 1 of thee, the mighty one; with the Maruts come hither, O Agni!
3. They who know of the great sky 1, the Visve Devas 2 without guile 3; with those Maruts come hither, O Agni!
4. The strong ones who sing their song 1, unconquerable by force; with the Maruts come hither, O Agni!
5. They who are brilliant, of terrible designs, powerful, and devourers of foes; with the Maruts come hither, O Agni!
6. They who in heaven are enthroned as gods, in the light of the firmament 1; with the Maruts come hither, O Agni!
7. They who toss the clouds 1 across the surging sea 2; with the Maruts come hither, O Agni!
8. They who shoot with their darts (lightnings) across the sea with might; with the Maruts come hither, O Agni!
9. I pour out to thee for the early draught1 the sweet (juice) of Soma; with the Maruts come hither, O Agni!
p. 54
NOTES.
This hymn is ascribed to Medhâtithi, of the family of Kanva. Verse I = SV I, 16.
Verse 1.
Wilson: Earnestly art thou invoked to this perfect rite, to drink the Soma juice; come, Agni, with the Maruts.
Benfey: Zu diesem schonen Opfer wirst du gerufen, zum Trank der Milch!—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!
Ludwig: Her zu diesem schönen opfer, gerufen wirst zum milchtrank du, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.
Note 1. Gopîthá is explained by Yâska and Sâyana as drinking of Soma. I have kept to the literal signification of the word, a draught of milk. In the last verse of our hymn the libation offered to Agni and the Maruts is said to consist of Soma, but Soma was commonly mixed with milk. The other meaning assigned to gopîthá, protection, would give the sense: 'Thou art called for the sake of protection.' But pîtha has clearly the sense of drinking in soma-pîthá, RV. I, 51, 7, and may therefore be taken in the same sense in gopîthá.
Verse 2.
Wilson: No god nor man has power over a rite (dedicated) to thee, who art mighty: come, Agni, with the Maruts.
Benfey: Denn nicht ein Gott, kein Sterblicher ragt über dein, des Grossen, Macht—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!
Ludwig: Es überragt kein gott, kein sterblicher die einsicht dein des grossen, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.
Note 1. The Sanskrit krátu expresses power both of body and mind. Parah governs the accusative.
Verse 3.
Wilson: Who all are divine, and devoid of malignity.
p. 55
and who know (how to cause the descent) of great waters: come, Agni, with the Maruts.
Benfey: Die guten Götter, welche all bestehen in dem weiten Raum—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!
Ludwig: Die wissen um den grossen raum, alle götter truges bar, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.
Note 1. The sky or welkin (rágas) is the proper abode of the Maruts, and 'they who know of' means simply 'they who dwell' in the great sky. The Vedic poets distinguish commonly between the three worlds, the earth, prithivî´, f., or pâ´rthiva, n.; the sky, rágas; and the heaven, dyú: see I, 6, 9, note 1. The phrase maháh rágasah occurs I, 6, 10; 168, 6, &c. Sâyana takes rágas for water or rain: see on this my article in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xii, p. 28. In some passages rágas means 'darkness,' and might be identified with the Greek Ἔρεβος; Ath. Veda VIII, 2, 1. pâráyâmi tvâ rágasa út tvâ mrityór apîparam, 'I bring thee out of darkness, out of death I brought thee.' The identification of rágas with ἔρεβος (Leo Meyer, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. vi, p. 19) must however remain doubtful, until stronger evidence has been brought forward in support of a Greek β representing a Sanskrit g, even in the middle of a word. See my article in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xv, p. 215; Curtius. Grundzüge (fifth edition), p. 480.
Note 2. The appellation Vísve devâ´h, all gods together, or, more properly, host-gods, is often applied to the Maruts; cf. I, 23, 8; 10. Benfey connects this line with the preceding verse, considering Vísve devâ´h, it seems, inappropriate as an epithet of the Maruts.
Note 3. On adrúh, without guile or deceit, without hatred, see Kuhn's excellent article, Zeitschrift für die Vergleichende Sprachforschung, vol. i, pp. 179, 193. Adrúh is applied to the Maruts again in VIII, 46, 4, though in connection with other gods. It is applied to the Visve Devas, RV. I, 3, 9; IX, 102, 5: the Âdityas, RV. VIII, 19, 34; 67, 13: the Rudras, RV. IX, 73, 7: to Heaven and Earth, RV. II, 41, 21; III, 56, 1; IV, 56, 2; VII, 66, 18: to Mitra and Varuna, RV. V, 68, 4: to Agni, RV. VI, 15, 7; VIII, 44, 10. The form adhrúk occurs in the sixth Mandala only.
p. 56
Verse 4.
Wilson: Who are fierce, and send down rain, and are unsurpassed in strength: come, Agni, with the Maruts.
Benfey: Die schrecklich-unbesiegbaren, die mächtiglich Licht angefacht—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!
Ludwig: Die singen, die gewaltigen, ihr lied unangegriffen durch (ihre) kraft, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.
Note 1. Sâyana explains arká by water. Hence Wilson: 'Who are fierce and send down rain.' But arká has only received this meaning of water in the artificial system of interpretation first started by the authors of the Brâhmanas, who had lost all knowledge of the natural sense of the ancient hymns. The passages in which arká is explained as water in the Brâhmanas are quoted by Sâyana, but they require no refutation. On the singing of the Maruts, see note to I, 38, 15; also Bergaigne, Journ. As. 1884, p. 194. The perfect in the Veda, like the perfect in Homer, has frequently to be rendered in English by the present.
Verse 5.
Wilson: Who are brilliant, of terrific forms, who are possessors of great wealth, and are devourers of the malevolent: come, Agni, with the Maruts.
Benfey: Die glänzend-grau’ngestaltigen, hochherrschend feindvernichtenden—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!
Ludwig: Die glanzvollen, von schrecklicher gestalt, von grosser herschaft, feindverzerer, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.
Verse 6.
Wilson: Who are divinities abiding in the radiant heaven above the sun: come, Agni, with the Maruts.
Benfey: Die Götter die im Himmel sind ob dem Lichtkreis des Göttersitz’s—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!
Ludwig: Die ob der himmeiswölbung glanz, am himel die götter sitzen, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.
Note 1. Nâ´ka must be translated by firmament, as there
p. 57
is no other word in English besides heaven, and that is wanted to render dyú. Like the Jewish firmament, the Indian nâ´ka, too, is adorned with stars; cf. I, 68, 10. pipésa nâ´kam stríbhih. Dyú, heaven, is supposed to be above the rágas, sky or welkin. Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xii, p. z8.
Sâyana: 'In the radiant heaven above the sun.' See note 1 to I, 6, 9; p. 49.
Verse 7.
Wilson: Who scatter the clouds, and agitate the sea (with waves): come, Agni, with the Maruts.
Benfey: Welche über das wogende Meer hinjagen die Wolkenschaar—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!
Ludwig: Die die berge wiegend hindurch durchs wogenmeer bewegen, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.
Note 1. That párvata (mountain) is used in the sense of cloud, without any further explanation, is clear from many passages:
I, 57, 6. tvám tám indra párvatam mahâ´m urúm vágrena vagrin parva-sáh kakartitha.
Thou, Indra, hast cut this great broad cloud to pieces with thy lightning. Cf. I, 85, 10.
We actually find two similes mixed up together, such as V, 32, 2. û´dhah párvatasya, the udder of the cloud. All we can do is to translate párvata by mountain, but always to remember that mountain means cloud. In the Edda, too, the rocks, said to have been fashioned out of Ymir's bones, are supposed to be intended for clouds. In Old Norse klakkr means both cloud and rock; nay, the English word cloud itself has been identified with the Anglo-Saxon clûd, rock. See Justi, Orient and Occident, vol. ii, p. 62. See Grimm, Deutsche Grammatik, 13, 398, 424; also Kuhn, Weisse Frau, p. 12.
Note 2. Whether the surging sea is to be taken for the sea or for the air, depends on the view which we take of the earliest cosmography of the Vedic Rishis. Sâyana explains: 'They who make the clouds to go, and stir the
p. 58
watery sea.' Wilson remarks that the influence of the winds upon the sea, alluded to in this and the following verse, indicates more familiarity with the ocean than we should have expected from the traditional inland position of the early Hindus, and it has therefore been supposed by others that, even in passages like our own, samudrá was meant for the sky, the waters above the firmament. But although there are passages in the Rig-veda where samudrá must be taken to mean the welkin (RV. I, 95, 3. samudrá ékam diví ékam ap-sú), this word shows in by far the larger number of passages the clear meaning of ocean. There is one famous passage, VII, 95, 2, which proves that the Vedic poets, who were supposed to have known the upper courses only of the rivers of the Penjâb, had followed the greatest and most sacred of their rivers, the Sarasvatî, as far as the Indian ocean. It is well known that, as early as the composition of the laws of the Mânavas, and possibly as early as the composition of the Sûtras on which these metrical laws are based, the river Sarasvatî had changed its course, and that the place where that river disappeared under ground was called Vinasana a, the loss. This Vinasana forms, according to the laws of the Mânavas, the western frontier of Madhyadesa, the eastern frontier being formed by the confluence of the Gangâ and Yamunâ. Madhyadesa is a section of Âryâvarta, the abode of the Âryas in the widest sense. Âryâvarta shares with Madhyadesa the same frontiers in the north and the south, viz. the Himalaya and Vindhya mountains, but it extends beyond Madhyadesa to the west and east as far as the western and eastern seas. A section of Madhyadesa, again, is the country described as that of the Brahmarshis, which comprises only Kurukshetra, the countries of the Matsyas, Pañkâlas (Kânyakubga, according to Kullûka), and Sûrasenas (Mathurâ, according to Kullûka). The most sacred spot of all, however, is that section of the Brahmarshi country which lies between the rivers Drishadvatî and Sarasvatî, and which in the laws of

p. 59
the Mânavas is called Brahmâvarta. In the Sûtras which supplied the material to the authors of the metrical law-books, the Vinasana is mentioned for the first time in the Baudhâyana Sûtras, I, 2, 9, 'Âryâvarta lies to the east of the region where (the Sarasvatî) disappears, to the west of the Black-forest, to the north of the Pâripâtra (mountains), to the south of the Himalaya.' The name of the Sarasvatî is not mentioned, but no other river can be understood. What is curious, however, is, that in the Vasishtha Sûtras where the same frontiers of Âryâvarta are given (I, 8), the MSS. read originally prâg âdarsât, i. e. east of the Âdarsa mountains, which was afterwards changed into prâg adarsanât, and interpreted 'east of the invisibility, or of the disappearance of the Sarasvatî.' Vasishtha quotes another authority, a Gâthâ of the Bhâllavins, which says: 'In the west the boundary river,' i. e. sindhur vidhâranî. This sindhur vidhâranî is another name of the old Sarasvatî, and in Baudhâyana I, 2, 12, the same verse is quoted, though the reading of vidhâranî varies with vikaranî and visaranî. See Bühler, l. c. Madhyadesa is mentioned in one of the Parisishtas (MS. 510, Wilson) as a kind of model country, but it is there described as lying east of Dasârna a, west of Kâmpilya b, north of Pâriyâtra c, and south of the Himavat, or again, in a more general way, as the Duâb of the Gangâ and Yamunâ d.
It is very curious that while in the later Sanskrit literature




p. 60
the disappearance of the Sarasvatî in the desert is a fact familiar to every writer, no mention of it should occur during the whole of the Vedic period, and it is still more curious that in one of the hymns of the Rig-veda we should have a distinct statement that the Sarasvatî fell into the sea:
VII, 95, 1-2. prá kshódasâ dhâ´yasâ sasre eshâ´ sárasvatî dharúnam â´yasî pû´h, pra-bâ´badhânâ rathyẫ-iva yâti vísvâh apáh mahinâ´ síndhuh anyâ´h. ékâ aketat sárasvatî nadî´nâm súkih yatî´ girí-bhyah â´ samudrâ´t, râyáh kétantî bhúvanasya bhû´reh ghritám páyah duduhe nâ´hushâya.
1. 'With her fertilising stream this Sarasvatî comes forth—(she is to us) a stronghold, an iron gate. Moving along as on a chariot, this river surpasses in greatness all other waters. 2. Alone among all rivers Sarasvatî listened, she who goes pure from the mountains as far as the sea. She who knows of the manifold wealth of the world, has poured out to man her fat milk.'
Here we see samudrá used clearly in the sense of sea, the Indian sea, and we have at the same time a new indication of the distance which separates the Vedic age from that of the later Sanskrit literature. Though it may not be possible to determine by geological evidence the time of the changes which. modified the southern area of the Penjâb and caused the Sarasvatî to disappear in the desert, still the fact remains that the loss of the Sarasvatî is later than the Vedic age, and that at that time the waters of the Sarasvatî reached the sea. Professor Wilson had observed long ago in reference to the rivers of that part of India, that there have been, no doubt, considerable changes here, both in the nomenclature and in the courses of the rivers, and this remark has been fully confirmed by later observations. I believe it can be proved that in the Vedic age the Sarasvatî was a river as large as the Sutlej, that it was the last of the rivers of the Penjâb, and therefore the iron gate, or the real frontier against the rest of India. At present the Sarasvatî is so small a river that the epithets applied to the Sarasvatî in the Veda have become quite inapplicable to it. The Vedic Rishis, though acquainted with numerous rivers, including
p. 61
the Indus and Ganges, call the Sarasvatî the mother of rivers (VII, 36, 6. sárasvatî saptáthî síndhu-mâtâ), the strongest of rivers (VI, 61, 13. apásâm apáh-tamâ), and in our passage, VII, 95, 2, we have, as far as I can judge, conclusive evidence that the old Sarasvatî reached in its course the Indian sea, either by itself, or united with the Indus a.
But this passage, though important as showing the application of samudrá, i. e. confluvies, to the Indian sea, and proving the acquaintance of the Vedic Rishis with the southern coast of India, is by no means the only one in which samudrá must be translated by sea. Thus we read, VII, 49, 2:
yâ´h â´pah divyâ´h utá vâ srávanti khanítrimâh utá vâ yâ´h svayam-gâ´h, samudrá-arthâh yâ´h súkayah pâvakâ´h tâ´h â´pah devî´h ihá mâ´m avantu.
The waters which are from heaven, or those which flow after being dug, or those which spring up by themselves, the bright, pure waters that tend to the sea, may those divine waters protect me here!
I, 71, 7. agním vísvâh abhí príkshah sakante samudrám ná sravátah saptá yahvî´h.
All kinds of food go to Agni, as the seven rivers go to the sea.
Cf. I, 190, 7. samudrám ná sravátah ródha-kakrâh.
V, 78, 8. yáthâ vâ´tah yáthâ vánam yáthâ samudráh égati.
As the wind moves, as the forest moves, as the sea moves (or the sky).
In hymn X, 58, the same expression occurs which we have in our hymn, and samudrám arnavám there as here admits but of one explanation, the surging sea.
Samudrá in many passages of the Rig-veda has to be taken as an adjective, in the sense of watery or flowing:
VI, 58, 3. yâ´s te pûshan nâ´vah antáh samudré hiranyáyîh antárikshe káranti.
Thy golden ships, O Pûshan, which move within the watery sky.

p. 62
VII, 70, 2. yáh vâm samudrâ´n sarítah píparti.
He who carries you across the watery rivers.
I, 161, 14. at-bhíh yâti várunah samudraíh.
Varuna moves in the flowing waters.
In both these passages samudrá, as an adjective, does not conform to the gender of the noun. See Bollensen, Orient und Occident, vol. ii, p. 467.
II, 16, 3. ná samudraíh párvataih indra te ráthah (ná pari-bhvẽ).
Thy chariot, O Indra, is not to be overcome by the watery clouds.
Verse 8.
Wilson: Who spread (through the firmament), along with the rays (of the sun), and, with their strength, agitate the ocean: come, Agni, with the Maruts.
Benfey: Die mit Blitzen schleuderen machtig über das Meer hinaus—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!
Ludwig: Die mit stralen ihre richtung nemen mit gewalt durchs mer, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.
Verse 9.
Wilson: I pour out the sweet Soma juice for thy drinking, (as) of old: come, Agni, with the Maruts.
Benfey: Ich giesse zu dem ersten Trank für dich des Soma Honig aus—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!
Ludwig: Ich giesze dir zum ersten trunk madhu mit dem soma zu; mit den Marut, Agni, kom.
Note 1. Pûrvapîti, the early draught, implies at the same time the priority of the god to whom it is given.
"

Verse 1.
Wilson: Celebrate, Kanvas, the aggregate strength of the Maruts, sportive, without horses, but shining in their car.
Benfey: Kanviden, auf! begrüsst mit Sang, die muntre Heerschaar der Marut’s, die rasch’ste, wagenglänzende.
Ludwig: Eurer spilenden schar, der Marutschar, der unangreifbaren, die auf wagen glänzt, der singt, o Kanvâs, zu.
Note 1. Wilson translates anarvâ´nam by without horses, though the commentator distinctly explains the word by without an enemy. A Brâhmana passage explains: bhrâtrivyo vâ arvâ, ity srutyantarât. See TS. IV, 3, 13, 6. Wilson considers it doubtful whether árvan can ever mean enemy. The fact is, that in the Rig-veda an-arván never means without horses, but always without hurt or free from enemies; and the commentator is perfectly right, as far as the sense is concerned, in rendering the word by without an enemy, or unopposed (apraty-rita). An-arván is not formed from árvat, horse, racer, but from árvan; and this is derived from the same root which yields árus, n. a wound, riti (see I, 64, 15, note), &c. The accusative of anarvat, without a horse, would be anarvantam, not anarvânam.
The root ar, in the sense of hurting, is distantly connected with the root mar: see Lectures on the Science of Language, Second Series, p. 323. It exists in the Greek ὄλλυμι corresponding to Sanskrit rinomi, i. e. arnomi, I hurt, likewise
p. 66
in οὐλή, wound, which cannot be derived from ὅλη; in οὖλος, οὔλιος, hurtful, and ὀλοός, destructive: see Curtius, Grundzüge der Griechischen Etymologie (fünfte Ausgabe), p. 372. In the Veda ar has the sense of offending or injuring, particularly if preceded by upa.
X, 164, 3. yát â-sásâ nih-sásâ abhi-sásâ upa-ârimá gâ´gratah yát svapántah, agníh vísvâni ápa duh-kritâ´ni águshtâni âré asmát dadhâtu.
If we have offended, or whatever fault we have committed, by bidding, blaming, or forbidding, while waking or while sleeping, may Agni remove all wicked misdeeds far from us.
Hence upârá, injury, VII, 86, 6. ásti gyâ´yân kánîyasah upa-aré, the older man is there to injure, to offend, to mislead, the young: (History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, second edition, p. 541.) Roth translates upârá by Verfehlung, missing. Ari, enemy, too, is best derived from this root, and not from râ, to give, with the negative particle, as if meaning originally, as Sâyana supposes, a man who does not give. In árarivân, gen. árarushah, hostile, Rosen recognised many years ago a participle of a really reduplicated perfect of ar, and he likewise traced aráru, enemy, back to the same root: see his note to I, 18, 3.
From this root ar, to hurt, árvan, hurting, as well as árus, wound, are derived in the same manner as both dhánvan and dhánus, bow, are formed from dhan; yágvan and yágus from yag, párvan and párus from par. See Kuhn, Zeitschrift, vol. ii, p. 233.
Anarván, then, is the same as ánarus, Sat. P. Brâhmana III, 1, 3, 7; and from meaning originally without a wound or without one who can wound, it takes the more general sense of uninjured, invulnerable, perfect, strong, (cf. integer, intact, and entire.) This meaning is applicable to I, 94, 2; 136, 5; II, 6, 5; V, 49, 4; VII, 20, 3; 97, 5; X, 61, 13; 65, 3. In I, 116, 16, anarván seems to be used as an adverb; in I, 51, 12, as applied to slóka, it may have the more general meaning of irresistible, powerful.
There are two passages in which the nom. sing. árvân, and one in which the acc. sing. árvânam, occur, apparently
p. 67
meaning horse. But in I, 163, 13, and IX, 97, 25, árvân stands in the Pada text only, the Samhitâ has árvâ̐ ákkha and árvâ̐ iva. In X, 46, 5, the text híri-smasrum ná árvânam dhána-arkam is too doubtful to allow of any safe induction, particularly as the Sâma-veda gives a totally different reading. I do not think, therefore, that árvat, horse, admits in the nom. and acc. sing. of any forms but árvâ and árvantam a. Pânini (VI, 4, 127) allows the forms arvân and arvânam, but in anarvan only, which, as we saw, has nothing in common with árvat, horse. Benfey: 'die rascheste (keinen Renner habend, uneinholbar),' the quickest (having no racer, hence not to be reached). M. Bergaigne (Journ. As. 1884, p. 188) tries to defend anarvan in the sense of anasva, without considering the grammatical objections. In VI, 66, 7 (not I, 6, 7) anasváh does not refer to yâmah.
The masculine anarvâ´nam after the neuter sárdhas is curious; sárdhas means might, but it is here used to express a might or an aggregate of strong men or gods, and the nom. plur. yé, who, in the next verse, shows the same transition of thought, not only from the singular to the plural, but also from the neuter to the masculine, which must be admitted in anarvâ´nam b. It would be possible, if necessary, to explain away the irregularity of anarvâ´nam by admitting a rapid transition from the Maruts to Indra, the eldest among the Maruts (cf. I, 23, 8. índra gyeshthâh márut-ganâh), and it would be easier still to alter sárdhas into sârdham, as an accusative singular of the masculine noun sárdha, which has the same meaning as the neuter sárdhas. There is one passage, V, 56, 9, which would seem to give ample countenance to such a conjecture:
tám vah sárdham rathe-súbham—â´ huve.
I call hither this your host, brilliant on chariots.
Again, II, 30, u, we read:
tám vah sárdham mâ´rutam—girâ´ úpa bruve.
I call with my voice on this your host of Maruts.


p. 68
VIII, 93, 16. srutám vah vritrahán-tamam prá sárdham karshanînâ´m, â´ sushe.
I pant for the glorious, victorious, host of the quick Maruts.
From this sárdha we have also the genitive sárdhasya, VII, 56, 8 (4):
subhráh vah súshmah krúdhmî mánâmsi dhúnih múnihiva sárdhasya dhrishnóh.
Your prowess is brilliant, your minds furious; the shout of the daring host is like one possessed.
We have likewise the dative sárdhâya, the instrumental sárdhena, and the acc. plur. sárdhân; and in most cases, except in two or three where sárdha seems to be used as an adjective, meaning strong, these words are applied to the host of the Maruts.
But the other word sárdhas is equally well authenticated, and we find of it, not only the nominative, accusative, and vocative sing. sárdhas, but likewise the nom. plur. sárdhâmsi.
The nominative singular occurs in our very hymn:
I, 37, 5. krilám yát sárdhah mâ´rutam.
Which is the sportive host of the Maruts.
I, 127, 6. sáh hí sárdhah ná mâ´rutam tuvi-svánih.
For he (Agni) is strong-voiced like the host of the Maruts.
IV, 6, 10. tuvi-svanásah mâ´rutam ná sárdhah.
Thy flames (Agni) are strong-voiced like the host of the Maruts.
V, 46, 5. utá tyát nah mâ´rutam sárdhah â´ gamat.
May also that host of the Maruts come to us.
II, 1, 5. tvám narâ´m sárdhah asi puru-vásuh.
Thou (Agni), full of riches, art the host of the men.
This host of men seems to me intended again for the Maruts, although it is true that in thus identifying Agni with different gods, the poet repeats himself in the next verse:
II, 1, 6. tvám sárdhah mâ´rutam.
Thou art the host of the Maruts.
If this repetition seems offensive, the first narâ´m sárdhas might be taken for some other company of gods. Thus we find:
p. 69
VII, 44, 5. srinótu nah daívyam sárdhah agníh i srinvántu vísve mahishâ´h ámûrâh.
May the divine host, may Agni, hear us, may the Visve hear us, the strong, the wise.
Or III, 19, 4. sáh â´ vaha devâ-tâtim yavishtha sárdhah yát adyá divyám yágâsi.
Bring thou hither, O Agni, the gods, that you may sacrifice to-day to the divine host.
Or I, 139, 1. â´ nú tát sárdhah divyám vrinîmahe.
We chose for us now that divine host.
As in these last, so in many other passages, sárdhas is used as a neuter in the accusative. For instance,
I, 106, 1; II, 11, 14. mâ´rutam sárdhah.
II, 3, 3; VI, 3, 8. sárdhah marútâm.
The vocative occurs,
V, 46, 2. ágne índra váruna mítra dévâh sárdhah prâ yanta mâ´ruta utá vishno (íti).
Agni, Indra, Varuna, Mitra, gods, host of the Maruts, come forth, and Vishnu!
We see how throughout all these passages those in which sárdha and sárdhas are applied to the Maruts, or to some other company of gods, preponderate most decidedly. Yet passages occur in the Rig-veda where both sárdha, and sárdhas are applied to other hosts or companies. Thus V, 53, 10, sárdha refers to chariots, while in I, 133, 3, sárdhas is applied to evil spirits.
If the passages hitherto examined were all that occur in the Rig-veda, we might still feel startled at the construction of our verse, where sárdhas is not only followed by masculine adjectives in the singular, but, in the next verse, by a pronoun in the plural. But if we take the last irregularity first, we find the same construction, viz. sárdhas followed by yé, in III, 32, 4:
índrasya sárdhah marútah yé â´san.
The host of Indra, that was the Maruts.
As to the change of genders, we find adjectives in the masculine after sárdhas, in
V, 52, 8. sárdhah mâ´rutam út samsa satyâ-savasam ríbhvasam.
p. 70
Celebrate the host of the Maruts, the truly vigorous, the brilliant.
Here, too, the poet afterwards continues in the plural, though as he uses the demonstrative, and not, as in our passage, the relative pronoun, we cannot quote this in support of the irregularity which has here to be explained. Anyhow the construction of our verse, though bold and unusual, is not so unusual as to force us to adopt conjectural remedies. In V, 58, 2, we find yé after ganáh. On the Umbrian Çerfo Martio, as possibly the same as sárdha-s mâ´ruta-s, see Grassman, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xvi, p. 190. The Zend saredha, kind, species, is the same word.
Verse 2.
Wilson: Who, borne by spotted deer, were born self-radiant, with weapons, war-cries, and decorations.
Benfey: Die mit Hirschen and Speeren gleich mit Donnern and mit Blitzen auch—selbststrahlende—geboren sind.
Ludwig: Die mit vilfarbigen speeren, mit der schwerter glanze, sichtbar wurden mit eignem leuchten.
Note 1. The spotted deer (príshatî) are the recognised animals of the Maruts, and were originally, as it would seem, intended for the rain-clouds. Sâyana is perfectly aware of the original meaning of príshatî, as clouds. The legendary school, he says, takes them for deer with white spots, the etymological school for many-coloured lines of clouds: (RV. BH. I, 64, 8.) This passage shows that although príshatî, as Roth observes, may mean a spotted cow or a spotted horse,—the Maruts, in fact, are called sometimes prishat-asvâh, having piebald horses, or, having prishats for their horses, VII, 40, 3,—yet the later tradition in India had distinctly declared in favour of spotted deer. The Vedic poets, however, admitted both ideas, and they speak in the same hymn, nay, in the same verse, of the fallow deer and of the horses of the Maruts. Thus V, 58, 1, the Maruts are called âsú-asvâh, possessed of quick horses; and in V, 58, 6, we read yát prá áyâsishta príshatîbhih ásvaih—ráthebhih, where the gender of príshatîbhih
p. 71
would hardly allow us to join it with ásvaih, but where we must translate: When you come with the deer, the horses, the chariots, or with your deer, as horses. Ludwig joins prishatîbhih with rishtibhih, and again in I, 64, 8; see note i to I, 87, 4.
Note 2. The spears and daggers of the Maruts are meant for the thunderbolts, and the glittering ornaments for the lightning. Sâyana takes vâ´sî in this passage for war-cries on the authority of the Nirukta, where vâ´sî is given among the names of the voice. From other passages, however, it becomes clear that vâ´sî is a weapon of the Maruts; and Sâyana, too, explains it sometimes in that sense: cf. V, 53, 4; 57, 2. Thus I, 88, 3, the vâ´sîs are spoken of as being on the bodies of the Maruts. In V, 53, 4, the Maruts are said to shine in their ornaments and their vâ´sîs. Here Sâyana, too, translates vâ´sî rightly by weapon; and in his remarks on I, 88, 3, he says that vâ´sî was a weapon commonly called ârâ, which is a shoemaker's awl. See Dhammapada, ver. 401. This reminds one of framea, which at one time was supposed to he connected with the German pfrieme. See, however, Grimm (Deutsche Grammatik, vol. i, p. 128) and Leo Meyer (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. vi, p. 424). In VIII, 29, 3, the god Tvashtar is said to carry an iron vâ´sî in his hand. Grassman (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xvi, p. 163) translates vâ´sî by axe. That is to be taken in the sense of ornament, and not in the sense of ointment, is shown by passages like VIII, 29, 1, where a golden ornament is mentioned, añgí aṅkte hiranyáyam. Sâkám, together, is used with reference to the birth of the Maruts; see I, 64, 4. It should not be connected with vâ´sîbhih.
Verse 3.
Wilson: I hear the cracking of the whips in their hands, wonderfully inspiring (courage) in the fight.
Benfey: Schier hier erschallt der Peitsche Knall, wenn sie in ihrer Hand erklingt; leuchtend fahr’n sie im Sturm herab.
Ludwig: Als ware es hier, so hört man es, wenn die geisslen in ihren händen knallen; wunderbar strecken sie auf ihrer fart sich nieder.
p. 72
Note 1. Eshâm should be pronounced as a creticus; also in verses 9, 13, 15. This is a very common vyûha. On the whips as lightning, see Grimm, Donner, p. 27.
Note 2. I should have taken kitrám as an adverb, like Benfey, if ni riñg were not usually construed with an accusative. Riñg in the 3rd pers. plur. pres. Âtm. is treated like a verb of the Ad-class. The SV. seems to read yâmam, and the commentator explains it by ratham.
Note 3. The locative yâ´man is frequently used of the path on which the gods move and approach the sacrifice; hence it sometimes means, as in our passage, in the sky. Yâ´mam in BR., s. v. arg, is wrong.
We might also translate: 'Here, close by, I hear what the whips in their hands say; they drive forth the beautiful (chariot) on the road.' See SV. I, 2, 1, 5, 1, comm.
Verse 4.
Wilson: Address the god-given prayer to those who are your strength, the destroyers of foes, the powerful, possessed of brilliant reputation.
Benfey: Singt eurer Schaar, der wühlenden, der strahlenreichen, kräftigen ein gotterfülletes Gebet!
Ludwig: Eurer künen schar, von blendender herlichkeit, der kraftvollen, soll ein von den göttern eingegebenes brahma gesungen werden.
Note 1. Benfey translates ghríshvi by burrowing, and refers it to the thunderbolt that uproots the earth. He points out that ghríshvi means also, for the same reason, the boar, as proved by Kuhn (Die Herabkunft des Feuers, S. 202). Ghrishti is evidently a common name for boar, the Norse gríss, and the god of the wind, Grimnir or Grimr, is conceived as a boar, shaking the cornfield, in such phrases as 'Der Eber geht ins Korn' (Gentha, l. c. p. 14). I prefer, however, in this place the general sense assigned to the adjective ghríshu and ghríshvi, exuberant, brisk, wild. See Kuhn in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xi, p. 385. Wilson, after Sâyana, translates destroyers of foes. On the representation of the clouds as boars, see Nir. V, 4.
Note 2. Tveshá-dyumna is difficult to render. Both
p. 73
tveshá and dyumná are derived from roots that mean to shine, to be bright, to glow. Derivatives from tvish express the idea of fieriness, fierceness, and fury. In IV, 17, 2, tvish is used correlatively, with manyú, wrath. Derivatives from dyu convey the idea of brightness and briskness. Both qualities are frequently applied to the Maruts.
Verse 5.
Wilson: Praise the sportive and resistless might of the Maruts, who were born amongst kine, and whose strength has been nourished by (the enjoyment of) the milk.
Benfey: Preist hoch die muntre Marutschaar die unbesiegbar in den Küh’n, im Schlund des Safts wuchs sie heran.
Ludwig: Preise wie unter kühen den stier, (so) der Marut spilende schar, beim verschlingen des saftes ist sie grosz geworden.
Note 1. This translation is merely conjectural. I suppose that the wind driving the clouds before him, is here compared to a bull among cows, cf. V, 52, 3:
té syandrâ´sah ná ukshánah áti skandanti sárvarîh.
They, the Maruts, like rushing bulls, mount on the dark cows.
The last sentence states that the wind grows even stronger after it has tasted the rain (I, 85, 2. té ukshitâ´sah mahimâ´nam âsata).
Note 2. I take gámbhe in the sense of gámbhane. (On the root gabh and its derivatives, see Kuhn, Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachwissenschaft, vol. i, p. 123 seq.) It would be better to read mukhe, instead of sukhe, in the commentary. The Maruts were not born of milk for Prisni, as Wilson says in a note, but from the milk of Prisni. Prisni is called their mother, Rudra their father: (V, 52, 16; 60, 5.)
Benfey takes the cows for clouds in which the lightnings dwell; and the abyss of the sap is by him supposed to be again the clouds.
p. 74
Verse 6.
Wilson: Which is chief leader among you, agitators of heaven and earth, who shake all around, like the top (of a tree)?
Benfey: Wer, Helden! ist der erste euch—ihr Erd- und Himmel-schû´tterer!—wenn ihr sie schû´ttelt Wipfeln gleich?
Ludwig: Wer ist der grô´sste bei euch, helden, wenn vom himel und der erde, schû´tteler, ihr am saume gleichsam rû´ttelt!
Note 1. Ántam ná, literally, like an end, is explained by Sâyana as the top of a tree. Wilson, Langlois, and Benfey accept that interpretation. Roth proposes, like the hem of a garment, which I prefer; for vastrânta, the end of a garment, is a common expression in later Sanskrit, while anta is never applied to a tree in the sense of the top of a tree. Here agra would be more appropriate.
Verse 7.
Wilson: The householder, in dread of your fierce and violent approach, has planted a firm (buttress); for the many-ridged mountain is shattered (before you).
Benfey: Vor eurem Gange beuget sich, vor eurem wilden Zorn der Mann; der Hügel weichet und der Berg.
Ludwig: Vor eurem anzug, eurem gewaltigen eifer, niederduckte sich der mensch, wich der festgeknotete [wolken]berg.
Note 1. Sâyana translates: 'Man has planted a firm buttress to give stability to his dwelling.' The reading ni for ni, which Aufrecht adopted, is untenable, as Ludwig shows. It has been altered in the second edition. See also VIII, 7, 5, ni yemiré. Nidadhré is the perfect Âtmanepada, and expresses the holding down of the head or the cowering attitude of man. I have taken ugrâ´ya manyáve over to gíhîta, because these words could hardly form an apposition to yâ´mâya. As the Vedic poets speak of the very mountains as shaken by the storms, we might translate párvato giríh by the gnarled or rocky mount;
p. 75
but there is no authority for translating gíhîta by it is shattered, and we should have to translate, the mountain yielded or bent before your anger. Cf. V, 57, 3:
ní vah vánâ gihate yâ´manah bhiyâ´.
The forests get out of your way from fear.
V, 60, 2. vánâ kit ugrâh gihate ní vah bhiyâ´ prithivî´ kit regate párvatah kit.
Even the forests, ye fearful Maruts, yield from fear of you; even the earth trembles, even the mountain.
In I, 166, 5, yát tveshá-yâmâh nadáyanta párvatân, we may translate 'when they on their fiery course made the parvatas (clouds) to sound or thunder,' but it is more likely that nâdayati here means to cause to shake or vibrate, and that parvata stands for mountain. We ought to remember such poetical expressions as 1 Kings xix. 11, 'and a great, strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord.'
Verse 8.
Wilson: At whose impetuous approach earth trembles; like an enfeebled monarch, through dread (of his enemies).
Benfey: Bei deren Lauf bei deren Sturm die Erde zittert voller Furcht, wie ein altergebeugter Mann.
Ludwig: Bei deren märschen zitterte wie ein gealtet stammeshaupt die erd vor furcht auf ihren wegen.
Note 1. Ágma seems to express the act of racing or running (like âgi, race, battle), while yâ´ma is the road itself where the racing takes place. A very similar passage occurs in I, 87, 3. The comparison of the earth (fem.) to a king (masc.) would be considered a grave offence in the later Sanskrit literature. In I, 87, 3, vithurâ´ takes the place of vispáti.
Verse 9.
Wilson: Stable is their birthplace, (the sky); yet the birds (are able) to issue from (the sphere of) their parent: for your strength is everywhere (divided) between two (regions,—or, heaven and earth).
p. 76
Benfey: Kaum geboren sind sie so stark, dass ihrer Mutter sie entfliehn: ist ja doch zwiefach ihre Kraft.
Ludwig: Denn fest ist ihr geburtsort, vögel (sind sie) von der mutter fortzugehn, nach dem, wie von altersher ihre kraft.
Oder, Denn fest ist ihre kraft geworden von der mutter sich zu trennen, da schon von alters her ihre kraft diss wollte.
Note 1. A very difficult verse. The birth of the Maruts is frequently alluded to, as well as their surpassing strength, as soon as born. Hence the first sentence admits of little doubt. But what follows is very abrupt. Váyas may be the plural of vi, bird, or it may be váyas, the neuter, meaning vital strength: see Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xv, p. 217. The Maruts are frequently compared to birds (cf. I, 87, 2; 88, I), but it is usual to indicate the comparison by ná or iva. I therefore take váyas as a nom. sing. neut., in the sense of vigour, life. They are called brihadvayasah in a Nivid; see Ludwig, p. 226. Nir-i is used with particular reference to the birth of a child (cf. V, 78, 7; 9).
Verse 10.
Wilson: They are the generators of speech: they spread out the waters in their courses: they urge the lowing (cattle) to enter (the water), up to their knees, (to drink.)
Benfey: In ihrem Lauf erheben dann diese Söhne Getös und Fluth, die bis zum Knie den Kühen geht.
Ludwig: Und dise söne, die sänger, denten auf ihren zügen ihre banen aus, so dass brüllend sie uns ganz nahe kamen.
Note 1. If we could take sûnávah gírah in the sense of the sons of voice, i. e. of thunder, which would remove many difficulties, the accent of gírah would have to be changed. The commentator takes sûnu in the sense of utpâdaka, producers of sound. Gírah, however, occurs at least once more, in the sense of singers or poets, IX, 63, 10, where gírah can only be a vocative, O ye singers! In I, 6, 6, the translation of gírah by singers, i. e. the Maruts, may be contested, but if we consider that gírah, in the sense of
p. 77
hymns, is feminine, and is followed by the very word which is here used, viz. devayántah, as a feminine, viz. devayántîh, VII, 18, 3, we can hardly doubt that in I, 6, 6, gírah is a masculine and means singers. The same applies to VI, 63, 10. In VI, 52, 9, ûpa nah sûnávah gírah srinvántu amrítasya yé, the construction is, of course, quite different.
Note 2. The expression that the Maruts enlarged or extended the fences of their race-course (RV. IV, 58, 7), can only mean that they swept over the whole sky, and drove the clouds away from all the corners. Kâ´shthâ may mean the wooden enclosures (carceres) or the wooden poles that served as turning and winning-posts (metae). The Sâma-Veda has yagñeshu instead of agmeshu. That the translation of this verse is purely tentative, and far from satisfactory, was known to all Vedic scholars, but I doubt whether they will consider the interpretation which M. Bergaigne proposes with so much assurance, as less tentative and more satisfactory. He translates (Journ. As. 1884, p. 239), des fils ont, dans leur marche, allongé leurs chants comme des chemins, pour y marcher à genoux (sur les genoux) en mugissant (en chantant).' I shall content myself with shortly pointing out the misgivings which every Vedic scholar would feel at once in proposing such a rendering. First as to the conception itself. Can a poet say, 'The Maruts have stretched out their songs in order to march on them on their knees?' 'The roads,' as M. Bergaigne shows himself, are only a simile, and no one walks on a simile. Secondly, the idea that these Maruts widened the roads on which they march, is common enough, but that they lengthened their songs, like paths, is never said by the Vedic Rishis, nor would they in such a case have left out the particle na or iva. Lastly, though many things are said of the Maruts, I do not remember that they ever appear on their knees. I do not think, therefore, that M. Bergaigne's infallible method helps us much beyond where we were before. Conjectures are easy, but for that very reason, one does not like to bring them forward. One might propose to read sûnávah diváh, a very common name of the Maruts. One might go a step further, identify
p. 78
gih with bhâratî, and point out that the Maruts are called the sons of Bharata, II, 36, 2. But all this leaves us in utter uncertainty, and where a scholar feels the ground so uncertain beneath his feet, he hesitates to speak with papal authority. M. Bergaigne's strong point is that abhigñú means on their knees, not up to their knees. Here again, I ask, does abhi in prepositional compounds ever mean on? If abhigñú is used in the same sense in which we use 'on our knees,' it would in Sanskrit mean only 'bowing up to the knees.' Now in I, 72, 5, abhigñú seems to express a positive expression of reverence. With regard to the other passages where abhigñú occurs, M. Bergaigne has not shown how they ought to be translated so as to give a clear sense. I do not pretend to solve the difficulties, but I think it is better to confess our difficulties than to hide them under the veil of a so-called systematic interpretation. Abhigñú, like mitagñu, may have expressed a position of the knees, expressive of strength, but on such points very little information is to be gained from Indian commentators.
The last sentence expresses the result of this race, viz. the falling of so much rain that the cows had to walk up to their knees in water. This becomes still clearer from the next verse.
Sâyana: These, the producers of speech, have spread water in their courses, they cause the cows to walk up to their knees hi order to drink the water.
Verse 11.
Wilson: They drive before them, in their course, the long, vast, uninjurable, rain-retaining cloud.
Benfey: Dann treiben sie im Sturm heran jenen langen and breiten Spross der Wolke unerschöpflichen.
Ludwig: Sogar disen langen, breiten, das kind der wolke, den unfeindlichen, schleudern auf ihren Zügen sie vorwärts.
Note 1. Rain is called the offspring of the cloud, mihó nápât, and is then treated as a masculine; cf. apâm nápât, &c.
p. 79
Verse 12.
Wilson: Maruts, as you have vigour, invigorate mankind: give animation to the clouds.
Benfey: O Marut’s! mit der Kraft, die ihr besitzt, werft ihr Geschöpfe um, die Berge werft ihr um sogar.
Ludwig: O Marut, so wie eure kraft ist, warft ihr die leute nieder, warft ihr die berge nieder.
Note 1. In VIII, 72, 8, akukyavît is explained by vyadârayat, he tore open. Akukyavîtana is the Vedic form of the 2nd pers. plur. of the reduplicated aorist.
Verse 13.
Wilson: Wherever the Maruts pass, they fill the way with clamour: every one hears their (noise).
Benfey: Wenn die Marut's des Weges ziehn, dann sprechen mit einander sie und mancher mag sie hören.
Ludwig: Wenn die Marut wandern, sprechen auf dem weg sie mit einander, es höret sie ein jeder.
Note 1. Yânti has to be pronounced as an amphibrachys.
Verse 14.
Wilson: Come quickly, with your swift (vehicles). The offerings of the Kanvas are prepared. Be pleased with them.
Benfey: Auf schnellen kommet schnell herbei, bei Kanva’s Spross sind Feste euch: da wollt euch schön ergötzen.
Ludwig: Brecht rasch auf mit raschen rossen, bei den Kanva’s ist euer dienst, dort eben erfreuet euch.
Note 1. Benfey supposes that dúvah stands in the singular instead of the plural. But why should the plural have been used, as the singular (asti) would have created no kind of difficulty? It is better to take dúvah as a nominative plural of a noun dû, worshipper, derived from the same root which yielded dúvah, worship. We certainly find á-duvah, as a nom. plur., in the sense of not-worshipping:
p. 80
VII, 4, 6. mâ´ tvâ vayám sahasâ-van avî´râh mâ´ ápsavah pári sadâma mâ´ áduvah.
May we not, O hero, sit round thee like men without strength, without beauty (cf. VIII, 7, 7), without worship.
Here Sâyana explains áduvah very well by parikaranahînâh, which seems better than Roth's explanation 'zögernd, ohne Eifer.'
Verse 15.
Wilson: The offering is prepared for your gratification: we are your (worshippers), that we may live all our life.
Benfey: Gerüstet ist für euren Rausch und wir gehören, traun! euch an für unser ganzes Lebelang.
Ludwig: Er ist euch zur trunkesfreude, und wir gleichfalls euer hier, dass unsere ganze dauer wir erleben.
"

3. Where are your newest favours 1, O Maruts? Where the blessings? Where all delights?

NOTES.
This hymn is ascribed to Kanva, the son of Ghora. The metre is Gâyatrî throughout. Several verses, however, end in a spondee instead of the usual iambus. No attempt should be made to improve such verses by conjecture, for they are clearly meant to end in spondees. Thus in verses 2, 7, 8, and 9, all the three pâdas alike have their final spondee. In verse 7, the ionicus a minore is with an evident intention repeated thrice. No verse of the hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV.; but verse 8 = TS. III, 1, 11, 5; verse 9 = TS. II, 4, 8, 1.
Verse 1.
Note 1. Kadha-priyah is taken in the Padapâtha as one word, and Sâyana explains it by delighted by or delighting in praise, a nominative plural. A similar compound, kadhapriya, occurs in I, 30, 20, and there too the vocative sing. fem., kadhapriye, is explained by Sâyana as fond of praise. In order to obtain this meaning, kadha has to be identified with kathâ, story, which is simply impossible. There is another compound, adha-priyâ, nom. dual, which occurs VIII, 8, 4, and which Sâyana explains either as delighted here below, or as a corruption of kadha-priyâ.
In Boehtlingk and Roth's Dictionary, kadha-priya and kadha-prî are both taken as compounds of kadha, an interrogative adverb, and priya or prî, to love or delight, and they are explained as meaning kind or loving to whom? In the same manner adha-priya is explained as kind then and there.
It must be confessed, however, that a compound like kadha-prî, kind to whom?, is somewhat strange, and it seems preferable to separate the words, and to write kádha priyá and ádha priyá.
It should be observed that the compounds kadha-prî and kadha-priya occur always in sentences where there is another interrogative pronoun. The two interrogatives kát—kádha, what—where, and kás—kádha, who—where, occurring in the same sentence, an idiom so common in
p. 84
[paragraph continues]
Greek, may have puzzled the author of the Pada text, and the compound being once sanctioned by the authority of Sâkalya, Sâyana would explain it as best he could. But if we admit the double use of the interrogative in Sanskrit, as in Greek, then, in our passage, priyáh would be an adjective belonging to pitâ´, and we might translate: 'What then now? When will you take (us), as a dear father takes his son by both hands, O ye Maruts?' In the same manner we ought to translate I, 30, 20:
káh te ushah kádha priye bhugé mártah amartye.
Who and where was there a mortal to be loved by thee, O beloved, immortal Dawn?
In VIII, 7, 31, where the same words are repeated as in our passage, it is likewise better to write:
kát ha nûnám kádha priyáh yát índram ágahâtana, káh vah sakhi-tvé ohate.
What then now? Where is there a friend, now that you have forsaken Indra? Who watches for your friendship?
Why in VIII, 8, 4, adha priyâ should have been joined into one word is more difficult to say, yet here, too, the compound might easily be separated.
Kádha does not occur again, but would be formed in analogy with ádha. It occurs in Zend as kadha.
Kuhn, Beiträge IV, p. 186, has shown that kûshthah (RV. V, 74, 1) is a similar monster, and stands for ku shthah.
The words kát ha nûnám commonly introduce an interrogative sentence, literally, What then now? cf. X, 10, 4.
Note 2. Vrikta-barhis is generally a name of the priest, so called because he has to trim the sacrificial grass. 'The sacred Kusa grass (Poa cynosuroides), after having had the roots cut off, is spread on the Vedi or altar, and upon it the libation of Soma-juice, or oblation of clarified butter, is poured out. In other places, a tuft of it in a similar position is supposed to form a fitting seat for the deity or deities invoked to the sacrifice. According to Mr. Stevenson, it is also strewn over the floor of the chamber in which the worship is performed.'
Cf. VI, II, 5. vriñgé ha yát námasâ barhíh agnaú, áyâmi srúk ghritá-vatî su-vriktíh.
p. 85
When I reverentially trim the truss for Agni, when the well-trimmed ladle, full of butter, is stretched forth.
In our passage, unless we change the accent, it must be taken as an epithet of the Maruts, they for whom the grass-altar has been prepared. They are again invoked by the same name, VIII, 7, 20:
kvã nûnám su-dânavah mádatha vrikta-barhishah.
Where do ye rejoice now, you gods for whom the altar is trimmed?
Otherwise, vrikta-barhishah might, with a change of accent, supply an accusative to dadhidhve: 'Will you take the worshippers in your arms?' This, though decidedly better, is not absolutely necessary, because to take by the hand may be used as a neuter verb.
Wilson: Maruts, who are fond of praise, and for whom the sacred grass is trimmed, when will you take us by both hands as a father does his son?
Benfey: Wo weilt ihr gern? was habt ihr jetzt—gleichwie ein Vater seinen Sohn—in Händen, da das Opfer harrt?
Verse 2.
Note 1. The idea of the first verse, that the Maruts should not be detained by other pursuits, is carried on in the second. The poet asks, what they have to do in the sky, instead of coming down to the earth. The last sentence seems to mean ' where tarry your herds?' viz. the clouds. Sâyana translates: 'Where do worshippers, like lowing cows, praise you?' Wilson: 'Where do they who worship you cry to you, like cattle?' Benfey: 'Wo jauchzt man euch, gleich wie Stiere? (Ihre Verehrer brüllen vor Freude über ihre Gegenwart, wie Stiere.)' The verb ranyati, however, when followed by an accusative, means to love, to accept with pleasure. The gods accept the offerings and the prayers:
V, 18, 1. vísvâni yáh ámartyah havyâ´ márteshu rányati.
The immortal who deigns to accept all offerings among mortals.
V, 74, 3. kásya bráhmâni ranyathah.
p. 86
Whose prayers do ye accept?
Followed by a locative ranyati means to delight in. Both the gods are said to delight in prayers (VIII, 12, 18; 33, 16), and prayers are said to delight in the gods (VIII, 16, 2). I therefore take ranyanti in the sense of tarrying, disporting, and ná, if it is to be retained, in the sense of not; where do they not sport? meaning that they are to be found everywhere, except where the poet desires them to be. We thus get rid of the simile of singing poets and lowing cows, which, though not too bold for Vedic bards, would here come in too abruptly. It would be much better, however, if the negative particle could be omitted altogether. If we retain it, we must read: kvã váh | gâváh | na rán yantí | . But the fact is that through the whole of the Rig-veda kvã has always to be pronounced as two syllables, kuva. There is only one passage, V, 61, 2, where, before a vowel, we have to read kva: kuva vo ’svâh, kvâbhîsavah. In other passages, even before vowels, we always have to read kuva, e. g. I, 161, 4. kuvet = kva it; I, 105, 4. kuvartam = kva ritam. In I, 35, 7, we must read either kuvedânîm sûryah, making sûryah trisyllabic, or kuva idânîm, leaving a hiatus. In I, 168, 6, kvâvaram is kuvâvaram: Sâkalya, forgetting this, and wishing to improve the metre, added na, thereby, in reality, destroying both the metre and the sense. Kva occurs as dissyllabic in the Rig-veda at least forty-one times.
Verse 3.
Note 1. The meanings of sumná, in the first five Mandalas are well explained by Professor Aufrecht in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. iv, p. 274. As to suvitâ´ in the plural, see X, 86, 21, and VIII, 93, 29, where Indra is said to bring all suvitas. It frequently occurs in the singular:
X, 148, 1. â´ nah bhara suvitám yásya kâkán.
Verse 4.
Note 1. One might translate: 'If you, sons of Prisni, were mortals, the immortal would be your worshipper.' But this seems almost too deep and elaborate a compliment for a primitive age. Langlois translates: 'Quand vous ne
p. 87
seriez pas immortels, (faites toutefois) que votre panégyriste jouisse d’une longue vie.' Wilson's translation is obscure: 'That you, sons of Prisni, may become mortals, and your panegyrist become immortal.' Sâyana translates: 'Though you, sons of Prisni, were mortal, yet your worshipper would be immortal.' Ludwig has, 'Wenn ihr, o kinder der Prisni, sterbliche wäret, der unsterbliche wäre euer sänger dann. Nicht werde euch unlieb der sänger, wie ein wildes tier auf der weide, nicht des Yama Pfad betrete er.' I think it best to connect the fourth and fifth verses, and I feel justified in so doing by other passages where the same or a similar idea is expressed, viz. that if the god were the poet and the poet the god, then the poet would be more liberal to the god than the god is to him. Whether syât should have the udâtta, I cannot tell. Thus I translated a passage, VII, 32, 18, in my History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 545: 'If I were lord of as much as thou, I should support the sacred bard, thou scatterer of wealth, I should not abandon him to misery. I should award wealth day by day to him who magnifies, I should award it to whosoever it be.' Another parallel passage is pointed out by Mr. J. Muir, (On the Interpretation of the Veda, p. 79; see also Sanskrit Texts, V, 303.) VIII, 19, 25: 'If, Agni, thou wert a mortal, and I were an immortal, I should not abandon thee to malediction or to wretchedness; my worshipper should not be miserable or distressed.' Still more to the point is another passage, VIII, 44, 23: 'If I were thou, and thou wert I, then thy wishes should be fulfilled.' See also VIII, 14, 1, 2.
As to the metre it is clear that we ought to read mārt̄â̆sāh sy̆â̄tănā.
Verse 5.
Note 1. Mâ´, though it seems to stand for ná, retains its prohibitive sense.
Note 2. Yávasa is explained by Sâyana as grass, and Wilson's Dictionary, too, gives to it the meaning of meadow or pasture grass, whereas yava is barley. The Greek ζεά or ζειά is likewise explained as barley or rye, fodder for horses. See I, 91, 13. gâ´vah ná yávaseshu, like cows in meadows.
p. 88
Note 3. The path of Yama can only be the path first followed by Yama, or that leads to Yama, as the ruler of the departed.
X, 14, 8. sám gakkhasva pitrí-bhih sám yaména.
Meet with the fathers, meet with Yama (X, 14, 10; 15, 8).
X, 14, 7. yamám pasyâsi várunam ka devám.
Thou wilt see (there) Yama and the divine Varuna.
X, 165, 4. tásmai yamâ´ya námah astu mrityáve.
Adoration to that Yama, to Death!
Wilson: Never may your worshipper be indifferent to you, as a deer (is never indifferent) to pasture, so that he may not tread the path of Yama.
Benfey: Wer euch besingt, der sei euch nicht gleichgültig, wie das Wild im Gras, nicht wandl’ er auf des Yama Pfad.
Ágoshya is translated insatiable by Professor Goldstücker.
Verse 6.
Note 1. One of the meanings of nírriti is sin. It is derived from the same root which yielded ritá, in the sense of right. Nírriti was conceived, it would seem, as going away from the path of right, the German Vergehen. Nírriti was personified as a power of evil and destruction.
VII, 104, 9. áhaye vâ tâ´n pra-dádâtu sómah â´ vâ dadhâtu níh-riteh upá-sthe.
May Soma hand them over to Ahi, or place them in the lap of Nirriti.
I, 117, 5. susupvâ´msam ná níh-riteh upá-sthe.
Like one who sleeps in the lap of Nirriti.
Here Sâyana explains Nirriti as earth, and he attaches the same meaning to the word in other places which will have to be considered hereafter. Cf. Lectures on the Science of Language, Second Series, p. 562.
Wilson treats Nirriti as a male deity, and translates the last words, 'let him perish with our evil desires.'
Note 2. Padîshtá is formed as an optative of the Âtmanepada, but with the additional s before the t, which, in the ordinary Sanskrit, is restricted to the so-called benedictive (Grammar, § 385; Bopp, Kritische Grammatik, ed. 1834,
p. 89
[paragraph continues]
§ 329, note). Pad means originally to go. Thus RV. IX, 73, 9, átra kartám áva padâti áprabhuh, may the impotent go down into the pit. In certain constructions it gradually assumed the meaning of to perish, and native commentators are inclined to explain it by pat, to fall. One can watch the transition of meaning from going into perishing in such phrases as VS. XI, 46, ma pâdy âyushah purâ, literally, 'may he not go before the time,' but really intended for 'may he not die before the time.' In the Rig-veda padîshtá is generally qualified by some words to show that it is to be taken in malam partem. Thus in our passage, and in III, 53, 21; VII, 104, 16; 17. In I, 79, 11, however, padîshtá sáh is by itself used in a maledictory sense, pereat, may he perish! In another, VI, 20, 5, pâ´di by itself conveys the idea of perishing. This may have some weight in determining the origin of the Latin pestis (Corssen, Kritische Beiträge, p. 396), for it shows that, even without prepositions, such as â or vi, pad may have an ill-omened meaning. In the Aitareya-brâhmana VII, 14 (History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 471), pad, as applied to a child's teeth, means to go, to fall out. With sam, however, pad has always a good meaning, and this shows that originally its meaning was neutral. Another translation, suggested by Ludwig, might be: 'Let not one dreadful Nirriti (sin) after another strike us.'
Verse 7.
Note 1. The only difficult word is avâtâ´m. Sâyana explains it, 'without wind.' But it is hardly possible to understand how the Maruts, themselves the gods of the storm, the sons of Rudra, could be said to bring clouds without wind. Langlois, it is true, translates without any misgivings: 'Ces dieux peuvent sur un sol desséché faire tomber la pluie sans l’accompagner de vent.' Wilson: 'They send down rain without wind upon the desert.' Benfey saw the incongruous character of the epithet, and explained it away by saying that the winds bring rain, and after they have brought it, they moderate their violence in order not to drive it away again; hence rain without wind. Yet even
p. 90
this explanation, though ingenious, and, as I am told, particularly truthful in an eastern climate, is somewhat too artificial. If we changed the accent, ávâtâm, unchecked, unconquered, would be better than avâtâ´m, windless. But ávâta, unconquered, does not occur in the Rig-veda, except as applied to persons. It occurs most frequently in the phrase vanván ávâtah, which Sâyana explains well by himsan ahimsitah, hurting, but not hurt: (VI, 16, 20; 18, 1; IX, 89, 7.) In IX, 96, 8, we read prit-sú vanván ávâtah, in battles attacking, but not attacked, which renders the meaning of ávâta perfectly clear. In VI, 64, 5, where it is applied to Ushas, it may be translated by unconquerable, intact.
There are several passages, however, where avâta occurs with the accent on the last syllable, and where it is accordingly explained as a Bahuvrîhi, meaning either windless or motionless, from vâta, wind, or from vâta, going. (I, 62, 10). In some of these passages we can hardly doubt that the accent ought to be changed, and that we ought to read ávâta. Thus in VI, 64, 4, avâte is clearly a vocative applied to Ushas, who is called ávâtâ, unconquerable, in the verse immediately following. In I, 52, 4, the Maruts are called avâtâh, which can only be ávâtâh, unconquerable; nor can we hesitate in VIII, 79, 7, to change avâtáh into ávâtah, as an epithet applied to Soma, and preceded by ádriptakratuh, of unimpaired strength, unconquerable.
But even then we find no evidence that ávâta, unconquered, could be applied to rain or to a cloud, and I therefore propose another explanation, though equally founded on the supposition that the accent of avâtâm in our passage should be on the first syllable.
I take vâta as a Vedic form instead of the later vâna, the past participle of vai, to wither. Similarly we find in the Veda gîta, instead of gîna, the latter form being sanctioned by Pânini. Vâ means to get dry, to flag, to get exhausted; ávâta therefore, as applied to a cloud, would mean not dry, not withered, as applied to rain, not dried up, but remaining on the ground. It is important to remark that in one passage, VI, 67, 7, Sâyana, too, explains ávâta, as applied to rivers, by asushka, not dry; and the same meaning would
p. 91
be applicable to avâtâ´h in I, 62, 10. In this sense of not withered, not dry, ávâtâm in our passage would form a perfectly appropriate epithet of the rain, while neither windless nor unconquered would yield an appropriate sense. In the famous passage, X, 129, 2, â´nît avâtám svadháyâ tát ékam, that only One breathed breathless by itself, avâtám might be taken, in accordance with its accent, as windless or breathless, and the poet may have wished to give this antithetical point to his verse. But ávâtam, as an adverb, would here be equally appropriate, and we should then have to translate, 'that only One breathed freely by itself.' Ludwig translates, 'Als treue die blendenden, die stürmenden Rudriya auf öder fläche sogar, als brunnen die wolke schaffen.' This presupposes the conjectural reading avatám.
Verse 8.
Note 1. The peculiar structure of the metre in the seventh and eighth verses should be noted. Though we may scan


by throwing the accent on the short antepenultimate, yet the movement of the metre becomes far more natural by throwing the accent on the long penultimate, thus reading


Sâyana: Like a cow the lightning roars, (the lightning) attends (on the Maruts) as the mother cow on her calf, because their rain is let loose at the time of lightning and thunder.
Wilson: The lightning roars like a parent cow that bellows for its calf, and hence the rain is set free by the Maruts.
Benfey: Es blitzt—wie eine Kuh brüllt es—die Mutter folgt dem Kalb gleichsam—wenn ihr Regen losgelassen. (Der Donner folgt dem Blitz, wie eine Kuh ihrem Kalbe.)
Vâsrá as a masculine means a bull, and it is used as a name of the Maruts in some passages, VIII, 7, 3; 7. As
p. 92
a feminine it means a cow, particularly a cow with a calf, a milch cow. Hence also a mother, X, 119, 4. The lowing of the lightning must be intended for the distant thunder, and the idea that the lightning goes near or looks for the rain is not foreign to the Vedic poets. See I, 39, 9: 'Come to us, Maruts, with your entire help, as lightnings (come to, i. e. seek for) the rain!'
Verse 9.
Note 1. That pargánya here and in other places means cloud has been well illustrated by Dr. Bailer, Orient and Occident, vol. i, p. 221. It is interesting to watch the personifying process which is very palpable in this word, and by which Parganya becomes at last a friend and companion of Indra. See now, 'India, what can it teach us?' p. 183 seq.
Verse 10.
Note 1. Sádma, as a neuter, means originally a seat, and is frequently used in the sense of altar: IV, 9, 3. sáh sádma pári nîyate hótâ; VII, 18, 22. hótâ-iva sádma pári emi rébhan. It soon, however, assumed the more general meaning of place, as
X, 1, 1. agníh bhânúnâ rúsatâ vísvâ sádmâni aprâh.
Agni with brilliant light thou filledst all places.
It is lastly used with special reference to heaven and earth, the two sádmanî, I, 185, 6; III, 55, 2. In our passage sádma pâ´rthivam is the same as pâ´rthive sádane in VIII, 97, 5. Here the earth is mentioned together with heaven, the sea, and the sky. Sâyana takes sádma as 'dwelling,' so do Wilson and Langlois. Benfey translates 'der Erde Sitz,' and makes it the subject of the sentence, which may be right: 'From the roaring of the Maruts the seat of the earth trembles, and all men tremble.' Sadman, with the accent on the last syllable, is also used as a masculine in the Rig-veda, I, 173, I; VI, 51, 12. sadmâ´nam divyám.
Verse 11.
Note 1. I have translated vîlu-pâníbhih, as if it were vîlupânibhih, for this is the right accent of a Bahuvrîhi
p. 93
compound. Thus the first member retains its own accent in prithú-pâni, bhû´ri-pâni vrísha-pâni, &c. It is possible that the accent may have been changed in our passage, because the compound is used, not as an adjective, but as a kind of substantive, as the name of a horse. Pâní, hand, means, as applied to horses, hoof:
II, 31, 2. prithivyâ´h sâ´nau gáṅghananta pâní-bhih.
When they strike with their hoofs on the summit of the earth.
This meaning appears still more clearly in such compounds as dravat-pâni:
VIII, 5, 35. hiranyáyena ráthena dravátpâni-bhih ásvaih.
On a golden chariot, on quick-hoofed horses.
The horses of the Maruts, which in our verse are called vîlu-pâní, strong-hoofed, are called VIII, 7, 27. híranyapâni, golden-hoofed:
ásvaih híranyapâni-bhih dévâsah ûpa gantana.
On your golden-hoofed horses come hither, O gods.
Those who retain the accent of the MSS. ought to translate, 'Maruts, with your strong hands go after the clouds.'
Note 2. Ródhasvatî is explained by Sâyana as river. It does not occur again in the Rig-veda. Ródhas is enclosure or fence, the bank of a river; but it does not follow that ródhasvat, having enclosures or banks, was applicable to rivers only. II, 15, 8, it is said that he emptied or opened the artificial enclosures of Bala, these being the clouds conquered by Indra. Hence I take ródhasvatî in the sense of a cloud yet unopened, which is followed or driven on by the Maruts.
Kitrá, bright or many-coloured, is applied to the clouds, V, 63, 3. kitrébhih abhráih.
Note 3. Roth and Ludwig take ákhidrayâman for a name of horse, which seems right. The word does not occur again in the Rig-veda.
Wilson: Maruts, with strong hands, come along the beautifully-embanked rivers with unobstructed progress.
Benfey: Mit euren starken Händen folgt den hehren eingeschlossnen nach in unermüd’tem Gang, Maruts.
p. 94
Verse 12.
Note 1. Abhî´su, rein, does not mean finger in the Rig-veda, though Sâyana frequently explains it so, misled by Yâska, who gives abhîsu among the names of finger. Wilson: 'May your fingers be well skilled (to hold the reins).'
Verse 13.
Note 1. Agni is frequently invoked together with the Maruts, and is even called marút-sakhâ, the friend of the Maruts, VIII, 92, 14. It seems better, therefore, to refer bráhmanas pátim to Agni, than, with Sâyana, to the host of the Maruts (marúdganam). Bráhmanaspáti and Bríhaspáti are both varieties of Agni, the priest and purohita of gods and men, and as such he is invoked together with the Maruts in other passages, I, 40, I. Tánâ is an adverb. meaning constantly, always, for ever. Cf. II, 2, I; VIII. 40, 7.
Wilson: Declare in our presence (priests), with voice attuned to praise Brahmanaspati, Agni, and the beautiful Mitra.
Benfey: Lass schallen immerfort das Lied zu grüssen Brahmanaspati, Agni, Mitra, den herrlichen.
Note 2. Mitra is never, as far as I know, invoked together with the Maruts, and it is better to take mitrám as friend. Besides ná cannot be left here untranslated. Ludwig translates, 'beautiful like Mitra,' that is, bright like the sun.
Verse 14.
Note 1. The second sentence is obscure. Sâyana translates: 'Let the choir of priests make a hymn of praise, let them utter or expand it, like as a cloud sends forth rain.' Wilson similarly: Utter the verse that is in your mouth, spread it out like a cloud spreading rain.' Benfey: 'Ein Preislied schaffe in dem Mund, ertöne dem Parganya gleich.' He takes Parganya for the god of thunder, and supposes the hymn of praise to be compared to it on account of its loudness. Tatanah can only be the second person singular of the conjunctive of the reduplicated perfect, of which we
p. 95
have also tatánat, tatánâma, tatánan, and tatánanta. Tatanah can be addressed either to the host of the Maruts, or to the poet. I take it in the latter sense, for a similar verse occurs VIII, 21, 18. It is said there of a patron that he alone is a king, that all others about the river Sarasvatî are only small kings, and the poet adds: 'May he spread like a cloud with the rain,' giving hundreds and thousands (pargányah-iva tatánat hí vrishtyâ´). Ludwig takes tan in the sense of thundering; thunder like Parganya!
Verse 15.
Note 1. It is difficult to find an appropriate rendering for arkín. It means praising, celebrating, singing, and it is in the last sense only that it is applicable to the Maruts. Wilson translates, 'entitled to adoration;' Benfey, 'flaming.' Boehtlingk and Roth admit the sense of flaming in one passage, but give to arkín in this place the meaning of praising. If it simply meant, possessed of arká, i. e. songs of praise, it would be a very lame epithet after panasyú. But other passages, like I, 19, 4; 52, 15, show that the conception of the Maruts as singers was most familiar to the Vedic Rishis (I, 64, 10; Kuhn, Zeitschrift, vol. i, p. 521. note); and arká is the very name applied to their songs (I, 19, 4). In the Edda, too, 'storm and thunder are represented as a lay, as the wondrous music of the wild hunt. The dwarfs and Elbs sing the so-called Alb-leich which carries off everything, trees and mountains.' See Justi in Orient and Occident, vol. ii, p. 62; Genthe, Windgottheiten, p. 4; 11. There is no doubt therefore that arkín here means musician, and that the arká of the Maruts is the music of the winds.
Note 2. Vriddhá, literally grown, is used in the Veda as an honorific epithet, with the meaning of mighty, great, or magnified:
III, 32, 7. yágâmah ít námasâ vriddhám índram
           brihántam rishvám agáram yúvânam.
We worship with praise the mighty Indra, the great, the exalted, the immortal, the vigorous.
Here neither is vriddhá intended to express old age,
p. 96
nor yúvan young age, but both are meant as laudatory epithets. See Darmesteter, Ormazd et Ahriman, p. 91 seq.
Asan is the so-called Let of as, to be. This Let is properly an imperative, which gradually sinks down to a mere subjunctive, and is generally called so. Of as, we find the following Let forms: belonging to the present, we have ásasi, II, 26, 2; ásati, VI, 23, 9; ásathah, VI, 63, 1; and ásatha, V, 61, 4: belonging to the imperfect, âsah, VIII, 100, 2; ásat, I, 9, 5; ásâma, I, 173, 9; ásan, I, 89, 1. Ásam, a form quoted by Roth from Rig-veda X, 27, 4, is really â´sam.
We find, for instance, ásah, with an imperative or optative meaning, in
VIII, 100, 2. ásah ka tvám dakshinatáh sákhâ me
              ádha vritrâ´ni â´ gaṅghanâva bhû´ri.
And be thou my friend on my right hand, and we shall kill many enemies.
Here we see the transition of meaning from an imperative to the conditional. In English, too, we may say, 'Do this and you shall live,' which means nearly the same as, 'If you do this, you will live.' Thus we may translate this passage: 'And if thou be my friend on my right side, then we shall kill many enemies.'
X, 124, I. imám nah agne úpa yagñám â´ ihi—
           ásah havya-vâ´t utá nah purah-gâ´h.
Here we have the imperative ihi and the Let ásah used in the same sense.
Far more frequently, however, ásah is used in relative sentences, such as,
VI, 36, 5. ásah yáthâ nah sávasâ kakânáh.
That thou mayest be ours, delighting in strength.
VII, 24, 1. ásah yáthâ nah avitâ´ vridhé ka.
That thou mayest be our helper and for our increase.
See also X, 44, 4; 85, 26; 36.
Wilson: May they be exalted by this our worship.
Benfey: Mögen die Hohen hier bei uns sein.

"
9,"MANDALA I, HYMN 39.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 18-19.",To the Maruts (The Storm-gods),"1. When you thus from afar cast forwards your measure 1, like a blast of fire, through whose wisdom is it, through whose design 2? To whom do you go, to whom, ye shakers (of the earth)?
2. May your weapons be firm to attack, strong also to withstand. May yours be the more glorious power, nor that of the deceitful mortal.
3. When you overthrow what is firm, O ye men, and whirl about what is heavy, you pass 1 through the trees of the earth, through the clefts of the rocks 2.
4. No real foe of yours is known in heaven, nor on earth, ye devourers of foes! May power be yours, together with your race 1! O Rudras, can it be defied 2?
5. They make the rocks tremble, they tear asunder the kings of the forest 1. Come on, Maruts, like madmen, ye gods, with your whole tribe.
6. You have harnessed the spotted deer to your chariots, a red one draws as leader 1; even the earth listened 2 at your approach, and men were frightened.
7. O Rudras, we quickly desire your help for our race. Come now to us with help, as of yore; thus now for the sake of the frightened Kanva 1.
8. Whatever fiend, roused by you or roused by men, attacks us, deprive him of power, of strength, and of your favours 1.
9. For you, chasing and wise Maruts, have wholly
p. 98
protected 1 Kanva. Come to us, Maruts, with your whole favours, as lightnings 2 (go in quest of) the rain.
10. Bounteous givers, you carry whole strength, whole power, ye shakers (of the world). Send, O Maruts, against the wrathful enemy of the poets an enemy, like an arrow 1.
p. 99
NOTES.
This hymn is ascribed to Kanva, the son of Ghora. The metre varies between Brihatî and Satobrihatî, the odd verses being composed in the former, the even verses in the latter metre. Each couple of such verses is called a Bârhata Pragâtha. The Brihatî consists of 8 + 8 + 12 + 8, the Satobrihatî of 12+ 8 + 12+ 8 syllables. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV.; verse 5 = TB. II, 4, 4, 3.
Verse 1.
Note 1. Mâ´na, which I translate by measure, is explained by Sâyana as meaning strength. Wilson: 'When you direct your awful vigour downwards from afar, as light (descends from heaven).' Benfey: 'Wenn ihr aus weiter Ferne so wie Strahlen schleudert euren Stolz (das worauf ihr stolz seid: euren Blitz).' Langlois: 'Lorsque vous lancez votre souffle puissant.' I doubt whether mâ´na is ever used in the Rig-veda in the sense of pride, which no doubt it has, as a masculine, in later Sanskrit: cf. Halâyudha, ed. Aufrecht, iv, 37. Mâ´na, as a masculine, means frequently a poet in the Rig-veda, viz. a measurer, a thinker or maker; as a neuter it means a measure, or what is measured or made. Thus V, 85, 5, we read:
mâ´nena-iva tasthi-vâ´n antárikshe ví yáh mamé prithivî´m sû´ryena.
He (Varuna) who standing in the welkin has measured the earth with the sun, as with a measure.
In this passage, as well as in ours, we must take measure, not in the abstract sense, but as a measuring line, which is cast forward to measure the distance of an object,—a simile, perfectly applicable to the Maruts, who seem with their weapons to strike the trees and mountains when they them, selves are still far off. Another explanation might be given, if mâ´na could be taken in the sense of measure, i. e. shape or form, but this is doubtful.
p. 100
Note 2. Várpas, which has generally been translated by body or form, is here explained by praise. Benfey puts Werk (i. e. Gesang, Gebet); Langlois, maison. Várpas, which, without much reason, has been compared to Latin corpus, must here be taken in a more general sense. Thus VI, 44, 14, asyá máde purú várpâmsi vidvâ´n, is applied to Indra as knowing many schemes, many thoughts, many things, when he is inspired by the Soma-juice; see I, 19, 5.
Note 1. Benfey takes ví yâthana in a causative sense, you destroy, you cause the trees to go asunder. But even without assigning to yâ a causative meaning, to go through, to pierce, would convey the idea of destruction. In some passages, however, vi-yâ is certainly used in the simple sense of passing through, without involving the idea of destruction:
VIII, 73, 13. ráthah viyâ´ti ródasî (íti).
Your chariot which passes through or between heaven and earth.
In other passages the mere passing across implies conquest and destruction:
I, 116, 20. vi-bhindúnâ … ráthena vi párvatân … ayâtam.
On your dissevering chariot you went across, or, you rent, the mountains (the clouds).
In other passages, however, a causative meaning seems equally, and even more applicable:
VIII, 7, 23. ví vritrám parva-sáh yayuh vi párvatân.
They passed through Vritra piecemeal, they passed through the mountains (the clouds); or, they destroyed Vritra, cutting him to pieces, they destroyed the clouds.
Likewise I, 86, 10. ví yâta vísvam atrínam.
Walk athwart every evil spirit, or destroy every evil spirit! See before, I, 19, 7; 37, 7.
We must scan vĭ ȳâ̆thănă vănĭnah prĭth̄ivy̆â̄h.
Note 2. It might seem preferable to translate â´sâh párvatânâm by the spaces of the clouds, for párvata means clouds in many places. Yet here, and still more clearly in verse 5, where párvata occurs again, the object of the poet
p. 101
is to show the strength of the Maruts. In that case the mere shaking or bursting of the clouds would sound very tame by the side of the shaking and breaking of the forest trees. Vedic poets do not shrink from the conception that the Maruts shake even mountains, and Indra is even said to have cut off the mountain tops: IV. 19, 4. áva abhinat kakúbhah párvatânâm. In the later literature, too, the same idea occurs: Mahâbh. Vana-parva, ver. 10974, dyauh svit patati kim bhûmir dîryate parvato nu kim, does the sky fall? is the earth torn asunder, or the mountain?
Verse 4.
Note 1. Sâyana was evidently without an authoritative explanation of tánâ yugâ´. He tries to explain it by 'through the union of you may strength to resist be quickly extended.' Wilson: 'May your collective strength be quickly exerted.' Benfey takes tánâ as adverb and leaves out yugâ´: 'Zu allen Zeiten, O Furchtbare!—sei im Nu zu überwält’gen euch die Macht.' Yugâ´, an instrumental, if used together with another instrumental, becomes in the Veda a mere preposition: cf. VII, 43, 5; 95, 4. râyâ´ yugâ´; X, 83, 3. tápasâ yugâ´; X, 102, 12. vádhrinâ yugâ´; VII, 32, 20. púram-dhyâ yugâ´; VI, 56, 2. sákhyâ yugâ´; VIII, 68, 9. tvâ´ yugâ´. As to the meaning of tán, see B. R. s. v., where tán in our passage is explained as continuation. The offspring or race of the Maruts is mentioned again in the next verse.
Note 2. I take nú kit â-dhríshe as an abrupt interrogative sentence, viz. Can it be defied? Can it be resisted? See V, 87, 2:
tát vah marutah ná â-dhríshe sávah.
Your strength, O Maruts, is not to be defied.
Verse 5.
Note 1. Large trees of the forest are called the kings or lords of the forest. Instead of pró ârata, the Taitt. Br. II, 4, 4, 2, reads pró varata, which Sâyana explains by pro, prakarshena, avârata dhâvata.
p. 102
Verse 6.
Note 1. Práshti is explained by Sâyana as a sort of yoke in the middle, when three horses or other animals are harnessed to a car; róhita as a kind of red deer. Hence Wilson remarks that the sense may be, 'The red deer yoked between them aids to drag the car.' But he adds that the construction of the original is obscure, and apparently rude and ungrammatical. Benfey translates, 'Sie führt ein flammenrothes Joch,' and remarks against Wilson that Sâyana's definition of práshti as yoke is right, but that of róhita as deer, wrong. If Sâyana's authority is to be invoked at all, one might appeal from Sâyana in this place to Sâyana VIII, 7, 28, where práshti is explained by him either by quick or by pramukhe yugyamânah, harnessed in front. The verse is
yát eshâm píshatîh ráthe práshtih váhati róhitah.
When the red leader draws or leads their spotted deer in the chariot.
VI, 47, 24. práshtih is explained as tripada âdhârah; tadvad vahantîti prashtayoऽsvâh. In I, 100, 17, práshtibhih, as applied to men, means friends or supporters, or, as Sâyana explains, pârsvasthair anyair rishibhih.
Ludwig (IV, ad 25, 8) adds some useful information. He quotes from the comm. on Taitt. S. I, 7, 8; vâmadakshinayor asvayor madhya îshâdvayam prasârya tayor madhye saptyâkhyagâtiviseshopetam asvam yuñgyât. The right horse is said to be the arvâ, the left vâgî, the middle saptih. Lâtyâyana II, 7, 23, calls the two side-horses prashtî. According to Sâyana (Taitt. S. I, 7, 8, p. 1024) prashti means originally a tripod for holding a pot (see above), and afterwards a chariot with three horses. In that case we should have to translate, the red chariot moves along.
Note 2. Aufrecht derives asrot from sru, to shake, without necessity, however; see Muir's Sanskrit Texts, IV, p. 494.
Ludwig also remarks that asrot might be translated by the earth trembled or vibrated. Similar passages occur RV. I, 127, 3. vîlú kit yásya sám-ritau srúvat vánâ-iva yát sthirám, at whose approach even what is firm and strong
p. 103
will shake, like the forests. Roth translates, the earth yielded, got out of your way.
Verse 7.
Note 1. Kanva, the author of the hymn.
Verse 8.
Note 1. The abhva, fiend, or, as Benfey translates it very happily, Ungethüm, may have been sent by the Maruts themselves, or by some mortal. With reference to yushméshita it is said afterwards that the Maruts are to withdraw their help from him. I have adopted Wilson's and Ludwig's interpretation of vi yuyota, with the instrumental.
Verse 9.
Note 1. The verb dadá is the second pers. plur. of the perfect of da, and is used here in the sense of to keep, to protect, as is well shown by B. and R. s. v. da 4, base dad. Sâyana did not understand the word, and took it for an irregular imperative; yet he assigned to the verb the proper sense of to keep, instead of to give. Hence Wilson: 'Uphold the sacrificer Kanva.' Benfey, less correctly, 'Den Kanva gabt ihr,' as if Kanva had been the highest gift of the Maruts.
Note 2. The simile, as lightnings go to the rain, is not very telling. It may have been suggested by the idea that the lightnings run about to find the rain, or the tertium comparationis may simply be the quickness of lightning. Wilson: 'As the lightnings bring the rain.' Benfey: '(So schnell) gleichwie der Blitz zum Regen kömmt.' Lightning precedes the rain, and may therefore be represented as looking about for the rain. Ludwig proposes some bold conjectures. He would change kánvam to ranvam, and take the words from asâmibhih to ganta as a parenthesis. He translates: 'For nothing imperfect, you highly to be revered Maruts, no, something delightful you gave—(with perfect aids, Maruts, come to us)—as lightnings give rain.'
Verse 10.
Note 1. Wilson: 'Let loose your anger.' Sâyana: 'Let loose a murderer who hates.'
p. 104
Pari-manyú, which occurs but once in the Rig-veda, corresponds as nearly as possible to the Greek περίθυμος. Manyú, like θυμός, means courage, spirit, anger; and in the compound parimanyú, as in περίθυμος, the preposition pári seems to strengthen the simple notion of the word. That pári is used in that sense in later Sanskrit is well known; for instance, in parilaghu, perlevis, parikshâma, withered away: see Pott, Etymologische Forschungen, second edition, vol. i, p. 487. How pári, originally meaning round about, came to mean excessive, is difficult to explain with certainty. It may have been, because what surrounds exceeds, but it may also have been because what is done all around a thing is done thoroughly. See Curtius, Grundzüge, fifth edition, p. 274. Thus we find in the Veda, VIII, 75, 9, pári-dveshas, lit. one who hates all around, then a great hater:
mâ´ nah … pári-dveshasah amhatíh, ûrmíh ná nâ´vam â´ vadhît.
May the grasp of the violent hater strike us not, as the wave strikes a ship.
Again, pari-sprídh means literally one who strives round about, then an eager enemy, a rival (fem.):
IX, 53, 1. nudásva yâ´h pari-sprídhah.
Drive away those who are rivals.
Pari-krosá means originally one who shouts at one from every side, who abuses one roundly, then an angry reviler. This word, though not mentioned in B. R.’s Dictionary, occurs in
I, 29, 7. sárvam pari-krosám gahi.
Kill every reviler!
The same idea which is here expressed by pari-krosá, is in other places expressed by pari-ráp, lit. one who shouts round about, who defies on every side, a calumniator, an enemy, one who 'be-rattles.'
II, 23, 3. â´ vi-bâ´dhya pari-rápah.
Having struck down the enemies.
II, 23, 14. ví pari-rápah ardaya.
Destroy the enemies.
In the same way as the words meaning to hate, to
p. 105
oppose, to attack, are strengthened by this preposition, which conveys the idea of round about, we also find words expressive of love strengthened by the same preposition. Thus from prîtáh, loved, we have pári-prîtah, lit. loved all round, then loved very much: I, 190, 6. pári-prîtah ná mitráh; cf. X, 27, 12. We also find IX, 72, 1. pari-príyah, those who love fully or all around, which may mean great lovers, or surrounding friends.
In all these cases the intensifying power of pári arises from representing the action of the verb as taking place on every side, thoroughly, excessively; but in other cases, mentioned by Professor Pott, particularly where this preposition is joined to a noun which implies some definite limit, its magnifying power is no doubt due to the fact that what is around, is outside, and therefore beyond. Thus in Greek περίμετρος expresses the same idea as ὑπέρμετρος (loc. cit. p. 488), but I doubt whether pári ever occurs in that sense in Sanskrit compounds.

"
10,"MANDALA I, HYMN 64.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 6-8.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. For the manly host, the joyful, the wise, for the Maruts bring thou, O Nodhas 1, a pure offering 2. I prepare songs, like as a handy priest 3, wise in his mind, prepares the water, mighty at sacrifices.
2. They are born, the tall bulls of Dyu 1 (heaven), the manly youths 2 of Rudra, the divine, the blameless, pure, and bright like suns; scattering raindrops, full of terrible designs, like giants 3.
3. The youthful Rudras, they who never grow old, the slayers of the demon 1, have grown irresistible like mountains. They throw down with their strength all beings, even the strongest, on earth and in heaven.
4. They deck themselves with glittering ornaments 1 for a marvellous show; on their chests they fastened gold (chains) for beauty 2; the spears on their shoulders pound to pieces 3; they were born together by themselves 4, the men of Dyu.
5. They who confer power 1, the roarers 2, the devourers of foes, they made winds and lightnings by their powers. The shakers milk the heavenly udders (clouds), they sprinkle the earth all round with milk (rain).
6. The bounteous 1 Maruts pour forth 2 water, mighty at sacrifices, the fat milk (of the clouds). They seem to lead 3 about the powerful horse, the cloud, to make it rain; they milk the thundering, unceasing spring 4
p. 107
7. Mighty they are, powerful, of beautiful splendour, strong in themselves 1 like mountains, (yet) swiftly gliding along;—you chew up forests, like wild elephants 2, when you have assumed your powers among the red flames 3.
8. Like lions they roar, the wise Maruts, they are handsome like gazelles 1, the all-knowing. By night 2 with their spotted deer (rain-clouds) and with their spears (lightnings) they rouse the companions together, they whose ire through strength is like the ire of serpents.
9. You who march in companies, the friends of man, heroes, whose ire through strength is like the ire of serpents 1, salute heaven and earth 2! On the seats on your chariots, O Maruts, the lightning stands, visible like light 3.
10. All-knowing, surrounded with wealth, endowed with powers, singers 1, men of endless prowess armed with strong rings 2, they, the archers, have taken the arrow in their fists.
11. The Maruts who with the golden tires of their wheels increase the rain, stir up the clouds like wanderers on the road. They are brisk, indefatigable 1, they move by themselves; they throw down what is firm, the Maruts with their brilliant spears make (everything) to reel 2.
12. We invoke with prayer 1 the offspring of Rudra, the brisk, the pure, the worshipful 2, the active. Cling 3 for happiness-sake to the strong company of the Maruts, the chasers of the sky 4, the powerful, the impetuous 5.
13. The mortal whom ye, Maruts, protected, he indeed surpasses people in strength through your protection. He carries off booty with his horses,
p. 108
treasures with his men; he acquires honourable 1 wisdom, and he prospers 2.
14. Give, O Maruts, to our lords strength glorious, invincible in battle, brilliant, wealth-acquiring, praiseworthy, known to all men 1. Let us foster our kith and kin during a hundred winters.
15. Will 1 you then, O Maruts, grant unto us wealth, durable, rich in men, defying all onslaughts 2?—wealth a hundred and a thousand-fold, always increasing?—May he who is rich in prayers 3 (the host of the Maruts) come early and soon!
p. 109
NOTES.
This hymn is ascribed to Nodhas, of the family of Gotama. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV.; but verse 6 = TS. III, 1, 11, 7.
Verse 1.
Note 1. The first line is addressed by the poet to himself.
Note 2. Suvriktí is generally explained by a hymn of praise, and it cannot be denied that in this place, as in most others, that meaning would be quite satisfactory. Etymologically, however, suvriktí means the cleaning and trimming of the grass on which, as on a small altar, the oblation is offered: cf. vriktabarhis, I, 38, 1, note 2, page 84. Hence, although the same word might be metaphorically applied to a carefully trimmed, pure, and holy hymn of praise, yet wherever in the Veda the primary meaning is applicable, it seems safer to retain it: cf. III, 61, 5; VI, 11, 5.
Prof. Roth, in the Mélanges Asiatiques, vii, p. 612, calls the derivation, which he himself discovered, a 'Columbus-Egg.' He derives suvrikti from su + rikti, and translates it by excellent praise. He supports the insertion of v, by the analogy of su-v-ita, for su-ita. This derivation is certainly very ingenious, but there are some difficulties which have still to be accounted for. That the substantive rikti does not occur by itself would not be fatal, because other words in the Veda occur as uttarapadas only. But there is the compound námovrikti in X, 131, 2, which shows that vrikti existed as a substantive, though it is true that the Vâgasaneyins (X, 32) read namaukti instead. Taitt. S. I, 8, 21; Taitt. Br. II, 6, 1, 3; and Ath. V. XX, 125, 2, have all namovrikti. There is also the compound svávrikti in RV. X, 21, 1. Are these to be separated from su-vrikti, and ought we not to take into consideration also the Zend hvarsta, as pointed out by M. Darmesteter (Ormazd,
p. 110
p. 10, note), meaning well performed, perfect in a liturgical sense?
Note 3. Apás, with the accent on the last syllable, is the accusative plural of ap, water, and it is so explained by Sâyana. He translates: 'I show forth these hymns of praise, like water, i. e. everywhere, as Parganya sends down rain at once in every place.' Benfey explains: 'I make these hymns smooth like water, i. e. so that they run smooth like water.' He compares ῥυθμός, as derived from ῥέω. Ludwig translates: Als ein kunstfertiger das werk im geiste, auch geschickt mit der hand mach ich schön die in der opferversammlungen mächtig wirkenden lieder.' I thought formerly that we ought either to change the accent, and read ápah, or the last vowel, and read apâ´h. In the former case the meaning would be, 'As one wise in mind and clever performs his work, so do I compose these hymns.' In the second case we should translate: 'Like a workman, wise in mind and handy, I put together these hymns.'
Still there is one point which has hitherto been overlooked by all translators, namely, that apáh vidátheshu âbhúvah, occurring in the first and sixth verses, ought to be taken in the same sense in both passages. Now apáh vidátheshu âbhúvah seems to mean water efficacious at sacrifices. In the sixth verse I now translate: 'The bounteous Maruts pour down water, mighty or efficacious at sacrifices, the fat milk (of the clouds).' Hence in the first verse I should now like to translate: 'I prepare my songs, like as a handy priest, wise in his mind, prepares the water mighty or efficacious at sacrifices.' Roth assigns to vidátha a too exclusively political meaning. Vidátha may be an assembly, a public meeting, a witenagemot, or an ἐκκλησία, but public meetings at that time had always a religious character, so that vidátha must often be translated by sacrifice.
Verse 2.
Note 1. It is difficult to say in passages like this, whether Dyu should be taken as heaven or as a personified deity. When the Maruts are called Rudrásya máryâh, the boys of
p. 111
[paragraph continues]
Rudra (VII, 56, 1), the personification is always preserved. Hence if the same beings are called Diváh máryâh, this too, I think, should be translated the boys of Dyu (III, 54, 13; V, 59, 6), not the sons of heaven. The bulls of Dyu is a more primitive and more vigorous expression for what we should call the fertilising winds of heaven.
Note 2. Márya is a male, particularly a young male, a young man, a bridegroom (I, 115, 2; III, 33, 10; IV, 20, 5; V, 61, 4, with vîra).
The Maruts have grown strong like well-grown manly youths. See also V, 59, 3.
V, 59, 5. máryâh-iva su-vrídhah vavridhuh nárah.
The men have grown strong like well-grown stallions.
In some passages it has simply the meaning of man:
I, 91, 13. máryah-iva své okyẽ.
Like a man in his own house.
Note 3. The simile, like giants, is not quite clear. Sátvan means a strong man, but it seems intended here to convey the idea of supernatural strength. Benfey translates, 'like brave warriors;' Wilson, 'like evil spirits.' Ghorávarpas is an adjective belonging to the Maruts rather than to the giants, and may mean of awful aspect, I, 19, 5, or of cruel mind; cf. I, 39, 1, note 2.
Verse 3.
Note 1. Abhog-ghánah, the slayers of the demon, are the slayers of the clouds, viz. of such clouds as do not yield rain. Abhog, not nurturing, seems to be a name of the rainless cloud, like Námuki (na-muk, not delivering rain), the name of another demon, killed by Indra; see Benfey, Glossar, s. v. The cloud which sends rain is called bhugmán:
VIII, 50, 2. giríh ná bhugmâ´ maghávat-su pinvate.
Like a feeding cloud he showers his gifts on the worshippers.
Verse 4.
Note 1. The ornaments of the Maruts are best described V, 54, 11:
p. 112
ámseshu vah rishtáyah pat-sú khâdáyah vákshah-su rukmâ´h.
On your shoulders are the spears, on your feet rings, on your chests gold ornaments. See also I, 166, 10, &c.
Rukmá as a masc. plur. is frequently used for ornaments which are worn on the breast by the Maruts. The Maruts are actually called rukmávakshasah, gold-breasted (II, 34, 2; V, 55, 1; 57, 5). In the Âsval. Srauta-sûtra IX, 4, rukma is mentioned as an ornament to be given to the Hotri priest; it is said to be round.
Note 2. Vápushe and subhé, as parallel expressions, occur also VI, 63, 6. Cf. Delbrück, K. Z. xviii, 96.
Note 3. Ní mimrikshur does not occur again in the Rig-veda, and Roth has suggested to read ní mimikshur instead; see ni + marg. He does not, however, give our passage under myak, but under mraksh, and this seems indeed preferable. No doubt, there is ample analogy for mimikshuh, and the meaning would be, their spears stick firm to their shoulders. But as the MSS. give mimrikshuh, and as it is possible to find a meaning for this, I do not propose to alter the text. The question is only, what does mimrikshuh mean? Mraksh means to grind, to rub, and Roth proposes to render our passage by 'the spears rub together on our shoulders.' The objections to this translation are the preposition ni, and the active voice of the verb. I take mraksh in the sense of grinding, pounding, destroying, which is likewise appropriate to mraksha-krítvan (VIII, 61, 10), and tuvi-mrakshá (VI, 18, 2), and I translate, 'the spears on their shoulders pound to pieces.'
Note 4. The idea that the Maruts owe everything, if not their birth, at least their strength (svá-tavasah, svá-bhânavah, sva-srítah), to themselves is of frequent occurrence in these hymns. See verse 7, note I.
Verse 5.
Note 1. They are themselves compared to kings (I, 85, 8), and called îsâná, lords (I, 87, 4).
Note 2. Dhúni is connected with root dhvan, to dun or
p. 113
to din. Sâyana explains it by bending or shaking, and Benfey, too, translates it by Erschütterer. Roth gives the right meaning.
Verse 6.
Note 1. I translate sudâ´navah by bounteous, or good givers, for, if we have to choose between the two meanings of bounteous or endowed with liquid drops or dew, the former is the more appropriate in most passages. We might, of course, admit two words, one meaning, possessed of good water, the other, bounteous; the former derived from dâ´nu, neuter, water, or rain, the other from dânú, giving. It cannot be denied, for instance, that whenever the Maruts are called sudâ´navah, the meaning, possessed of good rain, would be applicable: I, 40, 1; 44, 14; 64, 6; 85, 10; II, 34, 8; III, 26, 5; V, 52, 5; 53, 6; 57, 5; VIII, 20, 18; X, 78, 5; I, 15, 2; 23, 9; 39, 10. Yet, even in these passages, while sudâ´navah in the sense of possessed of good rain is possible throughout, that of good giver would sometimes be preferable, for instance, I, 15, 2, as compared with I, 15, 3. Though sudâ´nu, in the sense of possessed of good water, sounds as strange as would suvrishti in the sense of possessed of good rain, or sumegha, possessed of good clouds, yet it is difficult to separate sudâ´navah and gîrádânavah, both epithets of the Maruts.
When the same word is applied to Indra, VII, 31, 2; X, 23, 6; to Vishnu, VIII, 25, 12; to the Asvins, I, 112, 11; to Mitra and Varuna, V, 62, 9; to Indra and Varuna, IV. 41, 8, the meaning of giver of good rain might still seem natural. But with Agni, VI, 2, 4; the Âdityas, V, 67, 4; VIII, 18, 12; 19, 34; 67, 16; the Vasus, I, 106, 1; X, 66, 12; the Visve, X, 65, 11, such an epithet would not be appropriate, while sudâ´navah, in the sense of bounteous givers, is applicable to all. The objection that dânu, giver, does not occur in the Veda, is of no force, for many words occur at the end of compounds only, and we shall see passages where sudâ´nu must be translated by good giver. Nor would the accent of dânú, giver, be an obstacle, considering that the author of the Unâdi-sûtras had no Vedic
p. 114
authority to guide him in the determination of the accent of dânú. Several words in nu have the accent on the first syllable. But one might go even a step further, and find a more appropriate meaning for sudâ´nu by identifying it with the Zend hudânu, which means, not a good giver, but a good knower, wise. True, this root dâ, to know, does not occur in the ordinary Sanskrit; and Hübschmann (Ein Zoroastrisches Lied, 1872, p. 48) tries to prove that the root dâ, to know, does not exist in Zend either. But even thus we might have the derivation in Sanskrit and Zend, while the root was kept alive in Greek only (δάημι, δάεις). This, however, is only a conjecture; what is certain is this, that apart from the passages where sudâ´nu is thus applied to various deities, in the sense of bounteous or wise, it also occurs as applied to the sacrificer, where it can only mean giver. This is clear from the following passages:
I, 47, 8. su-kríte su-dâ´nave.
To him who acts well and gives well.
VII, 96, 4. gani-yántah nú ágravah putri-yántah su-dâ´navah, sárasvantam havâmahe.
We, being unmarried, and wishing for wives and wishing for sons, offering sacrifices, call now upon Sarasvat.
VIII, 103, 7. su-dâ´navah deva-yávah.
Offering sacrifices, and longing for the gods. Cf. X, 172, 2; 3; VI, 16, 8.
IV, 4, 7. sáh ít agne astu su-bhágah su-dâ´nuh yáh tvâ nítyena havíshâ yáh ukthaíh píprîshati.
O Agni, let the liberal sacrificer be happy, who wishes to please thee by perpetual offerings and hymns. See also VI, 16, 8; 68, 5; X, 172, 2, 3.
It must be confessed that even the meaning of dâ´nu is by no means quite clear. It is clear enough where it means demon, II, 11, 18; 12, 11; IV, 30, 7; X, 120, 6, the seven demons. In I, 32, 9; III, 30, 8, dâ´nu, demon, is applied to the mother of Vritra, the dark cloud. From this dâ´nu we have the derivative dânavá, meaning again demon. Why the demons, conquered by Indra, were called dâ´nu, is not clear, unless they were conceived originally as dark clouds, like Dânu, the mother of Indra. Dânu might mean wise,
p. 115
or even powerful, for this meaning also is ascribed to dânú by the author of the Unâdi-sûtras. If the latter meaning is authentic, and not only deduced ex post from the name of Dânu and Dânava, it might throw light on the Celtic dána, fortis, from which Zeuss derives the name of the Danube.
Sometimes dâ´nu, as a neuter, is explained as Soma:
X, 43, 7. â´pah ná síndhum abhí yát sam-áksharan sómâsah índram kulyâ´h-iva hradám, várdhanti víprâh máhah asya sádane yávam ná vrishtíh divyéna dâ´nunâ.
When the Somas run together to Indra, like water to the river, like channels to the lake, then the priests increase his greatness in the sanctuary, as rain the corn, by the heavenly Soma-juice, or by heavenly moisture.
In the next verse gîrádânu is explained as the sacrificer whose Soma is always alive, always ready.
In VI, 50, 13, however, dâ´nu páprih is doubtful. As an epithet to Apâ´m nápât, it may mean he who wishes for Soma, or he who grants Soma; but in neither case is there any tangible sense, unless Soma is taken as a name of the fertilising rain or dew. Again, VIII, 25, 5, Mitra and Varuna are called sriprá-dânû, which may mean possessed of flowing rain. And in the next verse, sám yâ´ dâ´nûni yemáthuh may be rendered by Mitra and Varuna, who brought together rain.
The fact that Mitra-Varunau and the Asvins are called dâ´nunaspátî does not throw much more light on the subject, and the one passage where dâ´nu occurs as a feminine, I, 54, 7, dâ´nuh asmai úparâ pinvate diváh, may be translated by rain pours forth for him, below the sky, but the translation is by no means certain.
Dâ´nukitra, applied to the dawn, the water of the clouds, and the three worlds (V, 59, 8; 31, 6; I, 174, 7), means most likely bright with dew or rain; and dâ´numat vásu, the treasure conquered by Indra from the clouds, can be translated by the treasure of rain. Taking all the evidence together, we can hardly doubt that dâ´nu existed in the sense of liquid, rain, dew, and also Soma; yet it is equally certain that dâ´nu existed in the sense of giver, if not of gift, and that from this, in certain passages, at all events,
p. 116
sudâ´nu must be derived, as a synonym of sudâ´van, sudâ´man, &c.
Spiegel admits two words dânu in the Veda and Avesta, the one meaning enemy, the other river. Darmesteter (Ormazd, p. 220) takes dânu as a cloud, water, or river. Ludwig translates sudânu by possessed of excellent gifts.
Note 2. I thought formerly that pinvanti was here construed with two accusatives, in the sense of 'they fill the water (with) fat milk.'
Cf. VI, 63, 8. dhenúm nah ísham pinvatam ásakrâm.
You filled our cow (with) constant food.
Similarly duh, to milk, to extract, is construed with two accusatives: Pan. I, 4, 51. gam dogdhi payah, he milks the cow milk.
RV. IX, 107, 5. duhânáh û´dhah divyám mádhu priyám.
Milking the heavenly udder (and extracting from it) the precious sweet, i. e. the rain.
But I now prefer to translate pinvanti apáh by they pour out water, and I take páyah ghritávat as a description of the water, namely, the fat milk of the clouds. After that parenthesis, vidátheshu âbhúvah is again an epithet of apáh, as it was in the first verse.
Note 3. The leading about of the clouds is intended, like the leading about of horses, to tame them, and make them obedient to the wishes of their riders, the Maruts. Átyah vâgî´ is a strong horse, possibly a stallion; but this horse is here meant to signify the clouds. Thus we read:
V, 83, 6. diváh nah vrishtím marutah rarîdhvam prá pinvata vríshnah ásvasya dhâ´râh.
Give us, O Maruts, the rain of heaven, pour forth the streams of the stallion (the cloud).
In the original the simile is quite clear, and no one required to be told that the átyah vâgî´ was meant for the cloud. Vâgín by itself means a horse, as I, 66, 2; 69, 3. vâgî´ ná prîtáh, like a favourite horse; I, 116, 6. paidváh vâgî´, the horse of Pedu. But being derived from vâ´ga, strength, vâgín retained always something of its etymological meaning, and was therefore easily and naturally transferred to the cloud, the giver of strength, the source
p. 117
of food. Even without the ná, i. e. as if, the simile would have been understood in Sanskrit, while in English it is hardly intelligible without a commentary. Benfey discovers some additional idea in support of the poet's comparison: 'Ich bin kein Pferdekenner,' he says, 'aber ich glaube bemerkt zu haben, dass man Pferde, welche rasch gelaufen sind, zum Uriniren zu bewegen sucht. So lassen hier die Maruts die durch ihren Sturm rasch fortgetriebenen Wolken Wasser herab strömen.'
Note 4. Útsa, well, is meant again for cloud, though we should hardly be justified in classing it as a name of cloud, because the original meaning of útsa, spring, is really retained, as much as that of avatá, well, in I, 85, 10-11. The adjectives stanáyantam and ákshitam seem more applicable to cloud, yet they may be applied also to a spring. Yâska derives utsa from ut-sar, to go forth; ut-sad, to go out; ut-syand, to well out; or from ud, to wet. In V, 32, 2, the wells shut up by the seasons are identified with the udder of the cloud.
Verse 7.
Note 1. Svátavas means really having their own independent strength, a strength not derived from the support of others. The yet which I have added in brackets seems to have been in the poet's mind, though it is not expressed. In I, 87, 4, the Maruts are called sva-srít, going by themselves, i. e. moving freely, independently, wherever they list. See I, 64, 4, note 4.
Note 2. Mrigâ´h hastínah, wild animals with a hand or a trunk, must be meant for elephants, although it has been doubted whether the poets of the Veda were acquainted with that animal. Hastín is the received name for elephant in the later Sanskrit, and it is hardly applicable to any other animal. If they are said to eat the forests, this may be understood in the sense of crushing or chewing, as well as of eating.
Note 3. The chief difficulty of the last sentence has been pointed out in B. and R.'s Dictionary, s. v. â´runî. Ârunî does not occur again in the whole of the Rig-veda. If we take it with Sâyana as a various reading of arunî´, then. the
p. 118
[paragraph continues]
Arunî´s could only be the ruddy cows of the dawn or of. Indra, with whom the Maruts, in this passage, can have no concern. Nor would it be intelligible why they should be called â´runî in this one place only. If, as suggested by B. and R., the original text had been yadâ´ aruñî´shu, it would be difficult to understand how so simple a reading could have been corrupted.
Another difficulty is the verb áyugdhvam, which is not found again in the Rig-veda together with távishî. Távishî, vigour, is construed with dhâ, to take strength, V, 32, 2. adhatthâh; V, 55, 2. dadhidhve; X, 102, 8. adhatta; also with vas, IV, 16, 14; with pat, X, 113, 5, &c. But it is not likely that to put vigour into the cows could be expressed in Sanskrit by 'you join vigour in the cows.' If távishî must be taken in the sense which it seems always to possess, viz. vigour, it would be least objectionable to translate, 'when you joined vigour, i. e. when you assumed vigour, while being among the Ârunîs.' The Ârunîs being the cows of the dawn, â´runîshu might simply mean in the morning. Considering, however, that the Maruts are said to eat up forests, â´runî in this place, is best taken in the sense of red flames, viz. of fire or forest-fire (dâvâgni), so that the sense would be, 'When you, Storms, assume vigour among the flames, you eat up forests, like elephants.' Benfey: 'Wenn mit den rothen eure Kraft ihr angeschirrt. Die rothen sind die Antilopen, das Vehikel der Maruts, wegen der Schnelligkeit derselben.'
Verse 8.
Note 1. As pisá does not occur again in the Rig-veda, and as Sâyana, without attempting any etymological arguments, simply gives it as a name of deer, it seems best to adopt that sense till something better can be discovered. Supís, too, does not occur again. In VII, 18, 2, pís is explained by gold, &c.; VII, 57, 3, the Maruts are called visvapís.
Note 2. Kshápah can only be the accusative plural, used in a temporal sense. It is so used in the expression kshápah usráh ka, by night and by day, lit. nights and days (VII, 15, 8). In VI, 52, 15, we find kshápah usrâ´h in the same sense.
p. 119
[paragraph continues]
IV, 53, 7. kshapâ´bhih áha-bhih, by night and by day. I, 44, 8, the loc. plur. vyúshtishu, in the mornings, is followed by kshápah, the acc. plur., by night, and here the genitive kshapáh would certainly be preferable, in the sense of at the brightening up of the night. The acc. plur. occurs again in I, 116, 4, where tisráh is used as an accusative (II, 2, 2; VIII, 41, 3). Kshapáh, with the accent on the last, must be taken as a genitivus temporalis, like the German Nachts (I, 79, 6). In VIII, 19, 31. kshapáh vástushu means at the brightening up of the night, i. e. in the morning. Thus, in III, 50, 4, Indra is called kshapâ´m vastâ´ ganitâ´ sû´ryasya, the lighter up of nights, the parent of the sun. In VIII, 26, 3, áti kshapáh, the genitive may be governed by áti. In IV, 16, 19, however, the accusative kshápah would be more natural, nor do I see how a genitive could here be accounted for:
dyâ´vah ná dyumnaíh abhí sántah aryáh kshapáh madema sarádah ka pûrvî´h.
May we rejoice many years, overcoming our enemies as the days overcome the nights by splendour.
The same applies to I, 70, 4, where kshapáh occurs with the accent on the last syllable, whereas we expect kshápah as nom. or acc. plural. Here B. and R. in the Sanskrit Dictionary, s. v. kshap, rightly, I believe, suppose it to be a nom. plur. in spite of the accent.
Verse 9.
Note 1. Áhimanyu comes very near to Angra-mainyu; cf. Darmesteter, Ormazd, p. 94.
Note 2. Ródasî, a dual, though frequently followed by ubhé (I, 10, 8; 33, 9; 54, 2), means heaven and earth, excluding the antáriksha or the air between the two. Hence, if this is to be included, it has to be added: I, 73, 8. âpapri-vâ´n ródasî antáriksham. Cf. V, 85, 3. We must scan r̆ōdăsî̄. See Kuhn, Beiträge, vol. iv, p. 193. Should rodasî stand for rodasîm, as elsewhere? She is certainly intended by what follows in the next line.
Note 3. The comparison is not quite distinct. Amati means originally impetus, then power, e. g. V, 69, 1:
p. 120
vavridhânâ´u amátim kshatríyasya.
Increasing the might of the warrior.
But it is most frequently used of the effulgence of the sun, (III, 38, 8; V, 45, 2; 62, 5; VII, 38, 1; 2; 45, 3.) See also V, 56, 8, where the same companion of the Maruts is called Rodasî´. The comparative particle ná is used twice.
Verse 10.
Note 1. See I, 38, 14, p. 95.
Note 2. In vrísha-khâdi the meaning of khâdi is by no means clear. Sâyana evidently guesses, and proposes two meanings, weapon or food. In several passages where khâdi occurs, it seems to be an ornament rather than a weapon, yet if derived from khad, to bite, it may originally have signified some kind of weapon. Roth translates it by ring, and it is certain that these khâdis were to be seen not only on the arms and shoulders, but likewise on the feet of the Maruts. There is a famous weapon in India, the kakra or quoit, a ring with sharp edges, which is thrown from a great distance with fatal effect. Bollensen (Orient and Occident, vol. ii, p. 46) suggests for vríshan the meaning of hole in the ear, and then translates the compound as having earrings in the hole of the ear. But vríshan does not mean the hole in the lap of the ear, nor has vrishabhá that meaning either in the Veda or elsewhere. Wilson gives for vrishabha, not for vrishan, the meaning of orifice of the ear, but this is very different from the hole in the lap of the ear. Benfey suggests that the khâdis were made of the teeth of wild animals, and hence their name of biters. Vríshan conveys the meaning of strong, though possibly with the implied idea of rain-producing, fertilising. See p. 138. In RV. V, 87, 1, Osthoff translates sukhâdáye by jucunde praebenti, Benfey by schönverzehrendem; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, IV, 70, has the right rendering. Cf. note to I, 166, 9.
Verse 11.
Note 1. Formerly explained as 'zum Kampfe wandelnd.' See Kuhn, Zeitschrift, vol. iv, p. 19.
p. 121
Note 2. Wilson: Augmenters of rain, they drive, with golden wheels, the clouds asunder; as elephants (in a herd, break down the trees in their way). They are honoured with sacrifices, visitants of the hall of offering, spontaneous assailers (of their foes), subverters of what are stable, immovable themselves, and wearers of shining weapons.
Benfey: Weghemmnissen gleich schleudern die Fluthmehrer mit den goldnen Felgen das Gewölk empor, die nie müden Kämpfer, frei schreitend-festesstürzenden, die schweres thu’nden, lanzenstrahlenden Maruts.
Verse 12.
Note 1. Havásâ, instead of what one should expect, hávasâ, occurs but once more in another Marut hymn, VI, 66, ii.
Note 2. Vanín does not occur again as an epithet of the Maruts. It is explained by Sâyana as a possessive adjective derived from vana, water, and Benfey accordingly translates it by fluthversehn. This, however, is not confirmed by any authoritative passages. Vanín, unless it means connected with the forest, a tree, in which sense it occurs frequently, is only applied to the worshippers or priests in the sense of venerating or adoring (cf. venero, venustus, &c.)
III, 40, 7. abhí dyumnâ´ni vanínah índram sakante ákshitâ.
The inexhaustible treasures of the worshipper go towards Indra.
VIII, 3, 5. índram vanínah havâmahe.
We, the worshippers, call Indra.
Unless it can be proved by independent evidence that vanín means possessed of water, we must restrict vanín to its two meanings, of which the only one here applicable, though weak, is adoring. The Maruts are frequently represented as singers and priests, yet the epithets here applied to them stand much in need of some definite explanation, as the poet could hardly have meant to string a number of vague and ill-connected epithets together. If one might conjecture, svânínam instead of vanínam would be an improvement. It is a scarce word, and occurs but once more
p. 122
in the Veda, III, 26, 5, where it is used of the Maruts, in the sense of noisy, turbulent.
Note 3. Saskata, which I have here translated literally by to cling, is often used in the sense of following or revering (colere):
II, I, 13. tvâ´m râti-sâ´kah adhvaréshu saskire.
The gods who are fond of offerings cling to thee, follow thee, at the sacrifices.
The Soma libation is said to reach the god:
II, 22, I. sáh enam saskat deváh devám. The gods too are said to cling to their worshippers, i. e. to love and protect them: III, 16, 2; VII, i8, 25. The horses are said to follow their drivers: VI, 36, 3; VII, 90, 3, &c. It is used very much like the Greek ὀπάζω.
Note 4. Ragastû´h may mean rousing the dust of the earth, a very appropriate epithet of the Maruts. Sâyana explains it thus, and most translators have adopted his explanation. But as the epithets here are not simply descriptive, but laudatory, it seems preferable, in this place, to retain the usual meaning of rágas, sky. When Soma is called ragastû´h, IX, 108, 7, Sâyana too explains it by tegasâm prerakam, and IX, 48, 4, by udakasya prerakam.
Note 5. Rigîshín, derived from rigîsha. Rigîsha is what remains of the Soma-plant after it has once been squeezed, and what is used again for the third libation. Now as the Maruts are invoked at the third libation, they were called rigîshín, as drinking at their later libation the juice made of the rigîsha. This, at least, is the opinion of the Indian commentators. But it is much more likely that the Maruts were invoked at the third libation, because originally they had been called rigîshín by the Vedic poets, this rigîshín being derived from rigîsha, and rigîsha from rig, to strive, to yearn, like purîsha from prî, manîshâ from man; (see Unâdi-sûtras, p. 273.) This rig is the same root which we have in ὀρέγειν, to reach, ὀργή, emotion, and ὄργια, furious transports of worshippers. Thus the Maruts from being called rigîshín, impetuous, came to be taken for drinkers of rigîsha, the fermenting and overflowing Soma, and were assigned accordingly to the third libation at sacrifices.
p. 123
[paragraph continues]
Rigîshín, as an epithet, is not confined to the Maruts; it is given to Indra, with whom it could not have had a purely ceremonial meaning (VIII, 76, 5).
Verse 13.
Note 1. Âpríkkhya, literally, to be asked for, to be inquired for, to be greeted and honoured. A word of an apparently modern character, but occurring again in the Rig-veda as applied to a prince, and to the vessel containing the Soma.
Note 2. Púshyati might be joined with krátu and taken in a transitive sense, he increases his strength. But púshyati is also used as an intransitive, and means he prospers:
I, 83, 3. ásam-yatah vraté te ksheti púshyati.
Without let he dwells in thy service and prospers.
Roth reads asamyattah, against the authority of the MSS.
Verse 14.
Note 1. The difficulty of this verse arises from the uncertainty whether the epithets dhanasprítam, ukthyãm, and visvákarshanim belong to súshma, strength, or to toká, kith and kin. Roth and Benfey connect them with toká. Now dhanasprít is applicable to toká, yet it never occurs joined with toká again, while it is used with súshma, VI, 19, 8. Ukthyã, literally, to be praised with hymns, is not used again as an epithet of toká, though it is quite appropriate to any gift of the gods. Lastly, visvákarshani is never applied to toká, while it is an epithet used, if not exactly of the strength, súshma, given by the gods, yet of the fame given by them:
X, 93, 10. dhâtam vîréshu visvá-karshani srávah.
Give to these men world-wide glory. Cf. III, 2, 15.
The next difficulty is the exact meaning of visvá-karshani, and such cognate words as visvá-krishti, visvá-manusha. The only intelligible meaning I can suggest for these words is, known to all men; originally, belonging to, reaching to all men; as we say, world-wide or European fame, meaning by it fame extending over the whole of Europe, or over the whole world. If Indra, Agni, and the Maruts are called by
p. 124
these names, they mean, as far as I can judge, known, worshipped by all men. Benfey translates allverständig.
Verse 15.
Note 1. Riti, the first element of riti-sáham, never occurs by itself in the Rig-veda. It comes from the root ar, to hurt, which was mentioned before (p. 65) in connection with ár-van, hurting, árus, wound, and ári, enemy. Sám-riti occurs I, 32, 6. Riti therefore means hurting, and riti-sáh means one who can stand an attack. In our passage rayím vîrá-vantam riti-sáham means really wealth consisting in men who are able to withstand all onslaughts.
The word is used in a similar sense, VI, 14, 4:
agníh apsâ´m riti-sáham vîrám dadâti sát-patim, yásya trásanti sávasah sam-kákshi sátravah bhiyâ´.
Agni gives a strong son who is able to withstand all onslaughts, from fear of whose strength the enemies tremble when they see him.
In other passages riti-sáh is applied to Indra:
VIII, 45, 35. bibháya hí tvâ´-vatah ugrâ´t abhi-prabhaṅgínah dasmâ´t ahám riti-sáhah.
For I stand in fear of a powerful man like thee, of one who crushes his enemies, who is strong and withstands all onslaughts.
VIII, 68, 1. tuvi-kûrmím riti-sáham índra sávishtha sát-pate.
Thee, O most powerful Indra, of mighty strength, able to withstand all onslaughts.
VIII, 88, 1. tam vah dasmám riti-sáham—índram gîh-bhíh navâmahe.
We call Indra the strong, the resisting, with our songs.
Note 2. The last sentence finishes six of the hymns ascribed to Nodhas. It is more appropriate in a hymn addressed to single deities, such as Agni or Indra, than in a hymn to the Maruts. We must supply sardha, in order to get a collective word in the masculine singular.
Nú, as usual, should be scanned n̆ū.
Note 3. Dhiyâ´-vasu, as an epithet of the gods, means rich in prayers, i. e. invoked by many worshippers. It does
p. 125
not occur frequently. Besides the hymns of Nodhas, it only occurs independently in I, 3, 10 (Sarasvatî), III, 3, 2, III, 28, 1 (Agni), these hymns being all ascribed to the family of Visvâmitra. In the last verse, which forms the burden of the hymns of Nodhas, it may have been intended to mean, he who is rich through the hymn just recited, or he who rejoices in the hymn, the god to whom it is addressed.
Nodhas, the poet, belongs, according to the Anukramanî, to the family of Gotama, and in the hymns which are ascribed to him, I, 58-64, the Gotamas are mentioned several times:
I, 60, 5. tám tvâ vayám pátim agne rayînâ´m prá samsâmah matí-bhih gótamâsah.
We, the Gotamas, praise thee with hymns, Agni, the lord of treasures.
I, 61, 16. evá, te hâri-yogana su-vriktí índra bráhmâni gótamâsah akran.
Truly the Gotamas made holy prayers for thee, O Indra with brilliant horses! See also I, 63, 9.
In one passage Nodhas himself is called Gotama:
I, 62, 13.


Gotama made a new song for the old (god) with brilliant horses, O Indra! May Nodhas be a good leader to us, O powerful Indra! May he who is rich in prayers (Indra) come early and soon!
I feel justified therefore in following the Anukramanî and taking Nodhas as a proper name. It occurs so again in
I, 61, 14. sadyáh bhuvat vîryãya nodhâ´h.
May Nodhas quickly attain to power!
In I, 124, 4. nodhâ´h-iva may mean like Nodhas, but more likely it has the general meaning of poet.

"
11,"MANDALA I, HYMN 85.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 6, VARGA 9-10.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. Those who glance forth like wives and yoke-fellows 1, the powerful sons of Rudra on their way, they, the Maruts, have indeed made heaven and earth to grow 2; they, the strong and wild, delight in the sacrifices.
2. When grown up 1, they attained to greatness; the Rudras have established their seat in the sky. While singing their song and increasing their vigour, the sons of Prisni have clothed themselves in beauty 2.
3. When these sons of the cow (Prisni) 1 adorn themselves with glittering ornaments, the brilliant 2 ones put bright weapons on their bodies 3. They drive away every adversary 4; fatness (rain) streams along their paths;—
4. When you 1, the powerful, who shine with your spears, shaking even what is unshakable by strength,—when you, O Maruts, the manly hosts 2, had yoked the spotted deer, swift as thought, to your chariots;—
5. When you had yoked the spotted deer before your chariots, hurling 1 the stone (thunderbolt) in the fight, then the streams of the red-(horse) 2 rush forth: like a skin 3 with water they water the earth.
6. May the swiftly-gliding, swift-winged horses carry you hither! Come forth with your arms 1! Sit down on the grass-pile; a wide seat has been made for you. Rejoice, O Maruts, in the sweet food 2.
p. 127
7. Strong in themselves, they grew 1 with might; they stepped to the firmament, they made their seat wide. When Vishnu 2 saved the enrapturing Soma, the Maruts sat down like birds on their beloved altar.
8. Like 1 heroes indeed thirsting for fight they rush about; like combatants eager for glory they have striven in battles. All beings are afraid of the Maruts; they are men terrible to behold, like kings.
9. When the clever Tvashtar 1 had turned the well-made, golden, thousand-edged thunderbolt, Indra takes it to perform his manly deeds 2; he slew Vritra, he forced out the stream of water.
10. By their power they pushed the well 1 aloft, they clove asunder the rock (cloud), however strong. Blowing forth their voice 2 the bounteous Maruts performed, while drunk of Soma, their glorious deeds.
11. They pushed the well (cloud) athwart this way, they poured out the spring to the thirsty Gotama. The Maruts with beautiful splendour approach him with help, they in their own ways satisfied the desire of the sage.
12. The shelters which you have for him who praises you, grant them threefold 1 to the man who gives! Extend the same to us, O Maruts! Give us, ye heroes 2, wealth with valiant offspring!
p. 128
NOTES.
This hymn is ascribed to Gotama. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS.; verse 6 = AV. XX, 13, 2; verse 7 = TS. IV, 1, 11, 3; verse 12 = TS. I, 5, 11, 5; TB. II, 8, 5, 6.
Verse 1.
Note 1. The phrase gánayah ná sáptayah is obscure. As gáni has always the meaning of wife, and sápti in the singular, dual, and plural means horse, it might be supposed that gánayah could be connected with sáptayah, so as to signify mares. But although gáni is coupled with patnî, I, 62, 10, in the sense of mother-wife, and though sápti is most commonly joined with some other name for horse, yet gánayah sáptayah never occurs, for the simple reason that it would be too elaborate and almost absurd an expression for vadavâh. We find sápti joined with vâgín, I, 162, 1; with ráthya, II, 31, 7; átyam ná sáptim, III, 22, 1; sáptî hárî, III, 35, 2; ásvâ sáptî-iva, VI, 59, 3.
We might then suppose the thought of the poet to have been this: What appears before us like race-horses, viz. the storms coursing through the sky, that is really the host of the Maruts. But then gánayah remains unexplained, and it is impossible to take gánayah ná sáptayah as two similes, like unto horses, like unto wives.
I believe, therefore, that we must here take sápti in its original etymological sense, which would be ju-mentum, a yoked animal, a beast of draught, or rather a follower, a horse that will follow. Sápti, therefore, could never be a wild horse, but always a tamed horse, a horse that will go in harness. Cf. IX, 21, 4. hitâ´h ná sáptayah ráthe, like horses put to the chariot; or in the singular, IX, 70, 10. hitáh ná sáptih, like a harnessed horse. The root is sap, which in the Veda means to follow, to attend on, to worship. But if sápti means originally animals that will go
p. 129
together, it may in our passage have retained the sense of yoke-fellow (σύζυγος), and be intended as an adjective to gánayah, wives. There is at least one other passage where this meaning would seem to be more appropriate,. viz.
VIII, 20, 23. yûyám sakhâyah saptayah.
You (Maruts), friends and followers! or you, friends and comrades!
Here it is hardly possible to assign to sápti the sense of horse, for the Maruts, though likened to horses, are never thus barely invoked as saptayah!
If then we translate, 'Those who glance forth like wives and yoke-fellows,' i. e. like wives of the same husband, the question still recurs how the simile holds good, and how the Maruts rushing forth together in all their beauty can be compared to wives. In answer to this we have to bear in mind that the idea of many wives belonging to one husband (sapatnî) is familiar to the Vedic poet, and that their impetuously rushing into the arms of their husbands, and appearing before them in all their beauty, are frequent images in their poetry. In such phrases as pátim ná gánayah and gánayah ná gárbham, the ganis, the wives or mothers, are represented as running together after their husbands or children. This impetuous approach the poet may have wished to allude to in our passage also, but though it might have been understood at once by his hearers, it is almost impossible to convey this implied idea in any other language.
Wilson translates: 'The Maruts, who are going forth, decorate themselves like females: they are gliders (through the air), the sons of Rudra, and the doers of good works, by which they promote the welfare of earth and heaven. Heroes, who grind (the solid rocks), they delight in sacrifices.'
Ludwig translates: 'Die ganz besonders sich schmücken wie frauen, die renner, zu ihrem zuge,' &c. This is possible, yet the simile sounds somewhat forced.
Note 2. The meaning of this phrase, which occurs very frequently, was originally that the storms by driving away the dark clouds, made the earth and the sky to appear
p. 130
larger and wider. It afterwards takes a more general sense of increasing, strengthening, blessing.
Verse 2.
Note 1. Ukshitá is here a participle of vaksh or uksh, to grow, to wax; not of uksh, to sprinkle, to anoint, to inaugurate, as explained by Sâyana. Thus it is said of the Maruts, V, 55, 3. sâkám gâtâ´h—sâkám ukshitâ´h, born together, and grown up together.
Note 2. The same expression occurs VIII, 28, 5. saptó (iti) ádhi sríyah dhire. See also I, 116, 17; IX, 68, 1.
Verse 3.
Note 1. Gó-mâtri, like gó-gâta, a name of the Maruts, who are also called prísni-mâtarah, sindhu-mâtarah.
Note 2. Subhrá is applied to the Maruts, I, i9, 5. Otherwise, no doubt, it might refer, as Ludwig remarks, to virúkmatah, always supposing that virúkmat is a feminine. Whether tanûshu subhrâh can stand for tanûshu subhrâsu is more doubtful.
Note 3. Virúkmatah must be an accusative plural. It occurs I, 127, 3, as an epithet of ógas; VI, 49, 5, as an epithet of the chariot of the Asvins. In our place, however, it must be taken as a substantive, signifying something which the Maruts wear, probably armour or weapons. This follows chiefly from X, 138, 4. sátrûn asrinât virúkmatâ, Indra tore his enemies with the bright weapon. In VIII, 20, 11, where rukmá occurs as a masculine plural, vi bhrâgante rukmâ´sah ádhi bâhúshu, their bright things shine on their arms, it seems likewise to be meant for weapons; according to Sâyana, for chains. In V, 55, 3; X, 78, 3, the Maruts are called vi-rokínah, bright like the rays of the sun or the tongues of fire.
Note 4. Observe the short syllable in the tenth syllable of this Pâda; Benfey, Vedica, p. 124; Lanman, Noun-Inflection, pp. 378, 543.
Verse 4.
Note 1. The sudden transition from the third to the second person is not unusual in the Vedic hymns, the fact
p. 131
being that where we in a relative sentence should use the same person as that of the principal verb, the Vedic poets frequently use the third.
Note 2. Vrísha-vrâta is untranslatable for reasons stated p. 138 seq.; it means consisting of companies of vríshans, in whatever sense that word be taken. Wilson in his translation mistakes ákyutâ for ákyutâh, and vrâta for vrata. He translates the former by 'incapable of being overthrown,' the latter by 'entrusted with the duty of sending rain,' both against the authority of Sâyana. Vríshavrăta occurs twice in the Rig-veda as an epithet of Soma only, IX, 62, 11; 64, 1.
Verse 5.
Note 1. If we take ádri for cloud, then ramh might have the meaning of stirring up.
V, 32, 2. tvám útsân ritú-bhih badbadhânâ´n áramhah.
Thou madest the springs to run that had been shut up by the seasons.
VIII, 19, 6. tásya ít árvantah ramhayante âsávah. His horses only run quick.
But ádri often means stone, in the sense of weapon, or bolt (cf. adrivah, voc., wielder of the thunderbolt), and ramhayati would then have the meaning of hurling. This is the meaning adopted by Benfey and Ludwig.
Note 2. The red may be the dark red cloud, but arushá has almost become a proper name, and its original meaning of redness is forgotten. Nay, it is possible that arushá, as applied to the same power of darkness which is best known by the names of Vritra, Dasyu, &c., may never have had the sense of redness, but been formed straight from ar, to hurt, from which arvan, arus, &c. (see p. 65 seq.). It would then mean simply the hurter, the enemy. It is possible also to take arushá in the sense of the red horse, the leader between the two Haris, when we ought to remember that the Maruts pour forth the streams of the stallion, RV. V, 83, 6. prá pinvata vríshnah ásvasya dhâ´râh, and that they lead about the horse to make it rain, RV. I, 64, 6. átyam ná mihé ví nayanti vâgínam.
p. 132
Note 3. Sâyana explains: 'They moisten the whole earth like a hide,' a hide representing a small surface which is watered without great effort. Wilson: 'They moisten the earth, like a hide, with water.' Langlois: 'Alors les gouttes d’eau, perçant comme la peau de ce (nuage) bienfaisant viennent inonder la terre.' Benfey: 'Dann stû´rzen reichlich aus der rothen (Gewitterwolke) Tropfen, mit Fluth wie eine Haut die Erde netzend. (Dass die Erde so durchnässt wird, wie durchregnetes Leder.)' If the poet had intended to compare the earth, before it is moistened by rain, to a hide, he might have had in his mind the dryness of a tanned skin, or, as Professor Benfey says, of leather. If, on the contrary, the simile refers to the streams of water, then kárma-iva, like a skin, might either be taken in the technical acceptation of the skin through which, at the preparation of the Soma, the streams (dhârâh) of that beverage are squeezed and distilled, or we may take the word in the more general sense of water-skin. In that case the comparison, though not very pointedly expressed, as it would have been by later Sanskrit poets, would still be complete. The streams of the red-(horse), i. e. of the cloud, rush forth, and they, whether the streams liberated by the Maruts, or the Maruts themselves, moisten the earth with water, like a skin, i. e. like a skin in which water is kept and from which it is poured out. The cloud itself being called a skin by Vedic poets (I, 129, 3) makes the comparison still more natural.
One other explanation might suggest itself, if the singular of kárma should be considered objectionable on account of the plural of the verb. Vedic poets speak of the skin of the earth. Thus:
X, 68, 4. bhû´myâh udnâ´-iva vi tvákam bibheda.
He (Brihaspati) having driven the cows from the cave, cut the skin of the earth, as it were, with water, i. e. saturated it with rain.
The construction, however, if we took kárma in the sense of surface, would be very irregular, and we should have to translate: They moisten the earth with water like a skin, i. e. skin-deep.

We ought to scan kārmḗvōdắbhīh vĭ́ ūndā́ntĭ bhû̄́mā for kārmēvă ŭdăbhīh vyūndāntĭ bhû̄mā would give an unusual cæsura.
Verse 6.
Note 1. AV. XX, 13, 2. With your arms, i. e. according to Sâyana, with armfuls of gifts. Though this expression does not occur again so baldly, we read I, 166, 10, of the Maruts, that there are many gifts in their strong arms, bhûrîni bhadrâ´ náryeshu bâhúshu; nor does bâhú, as used in the plural, as far as I am able to judge, ever convey any meaning but that of arms. The idea that the Maruts are carried along by their arms as by wings, does not rest on Vedic authority, otherwise we might join raghupátvânah with bâhúbhih, come forth swiftly flying on your arms! As it is, and with the accent on the antepenultimate, we must refer raghupátvânah to sáptayah, horses.
Note 2. The sweet food is Soma.
Verse 7.
Note 1. The initial 'a' of avardhanta must be elided, or 'té a' be pronounced as two short syllables equal to one long.
Note 2. Taitt. S. IV, I, 11, 3. Vishnu, whose character in the hymns of the Veda is very different from that assumed by him in later periods of Hindu religion, must here be taken as the friend and companion of Indra. Like the Maruts, he assisted Indra in his battle against Vritra and the conquest of the clouds. When Indra was forsaken by all the gods, Vishnu came to his help.
IV, 18, 11. utá mâtâ´ mahishám ánu avenat amî´ (iti) tvâ gahati putra devâ´h,
átha abravît vritrám índrah hanishyán sákhe vishno (íti) vi-tarám ví kramasva.
The mother also called after the bull, these gods forsake thee, O son; then, when going to kill Vritra, Indra said, Friend, Vishnu, step forward!
This stepping of Vishnu is emblematic of the rising, the culminating, and setting of the sun; and in VIII, 12, 27,
p. 134
[paragraph continues]
Vishnu is said to perform it through the power of Indra. In VI, 20, 2, Indra is said to have killed Vritra, assisted by Vishnu (víshnunâ sakânáh). Vishnu is therefore invoked together with Indra, VI, 69, 8; VII, 99; with the Maruts, V, 87; VII, 36, 9. In VII, 93, 8, Indra, Vishnu, and the Maruts are called upon together. Nay, mâ´ruta, belonging ta the Maruts, becomes actually an epithet of Vishnu, V, 46, 2. mâ´ruta utá vishno (iti); and in I, 156, 4. mâ´rutasya vedhásah has been pointed out by Roth as an appellation of Vishnu. The mention of Vishnu in our hymn is therefore by no means exceptional, but the whole purport of this verse is nevertheless very doubtful, chiefly owing to the fact that several of the words occurring in it lend themselves to different interpretations.
The translations of Wilson, Benfey, and others have not rendered the sense which the poet intends to describe at all clear. Wilson says: 'May they for whom Vishnu defends (the sacrifice), that bestows all desires and confers delight, come (quickly) like birds, and sit down upon the pleasant and sacred grass.' Benfey: 'Wenn Vishnu schützt den rauschtriefenden tropfenden (Soma), sitzen wie Vögel sie auf der geliebten Streu.' Langlois: 'Quand Vichnou vient prendre sa part de nos enivrantes libations, eux, comme des oiseaux, arrivent aussi sur le cousa qui leur est cher.' Ludwig: 'Als Vishnu half dem zum rauschtrank eilenden stiere, setzten sie sich wie vögel aufs liebe barhis.'
Whence all these varieties? First, because â´vat may mean, he defended or protected, but likewise, it is supposed, he descried, became aware. Secondly, because vríshan is one of the most vague and hence most difficult words in the Veda, and may mean Indra, Soma, or the cloud: (see the note on Vríshan, p. 138.) Thirdly, because the adjective belonging to vríshan, which generally helps us to determine which vríshan is meant, is here itself of doubtful import, and certainly applicable to Indra as well as to Soma and the Asvins, possibly even to the cloud. Mada-kyút is readily explained by the commentators as bringing down pride, a meaning which the word might well have in modern Sanskrit, but which it clearly has not in
p. 135
the Veda. Even where the thunderbolt of Indra is called madakyút, and where the meaning of 'bringing down pride' would seem most appropriate, we ought to translate 'wildly rushing down.'
VIII, 96, 5. â´ yát vágram bâhvóh indra dhátse madakyútam áhaye hántavai ûm (iti).
When thou tookest the wildly rushing thunderbolt in thy arms in order to slay Ahi.
When applied to the gods, the meaning of madakyút is by no means certain. It might mean rushing about fiercely, reeling with delight, this delight being produced by the Soma, but it may also mean sending down delight, i. e. rain or Soma. The root kyu is particularly applicable to the sending down of rain; cf. Taitt. Samh. II, 4, 9, 2; 10, 3; III, 3, 4, 1; and Indra and his horses, to whom this epithet is chiefly applied, are frequently asked to send down rain. However, madakyút is also applied to real horses (I, 126, 4) where givers of rain would be an inappropriate epithet. I should therefore translate madakyút, when applied to Indra, to his horses, to the Asvins, or to horses in general by furiously or wildly moving about, as if 'made or madena kyavate,' he moves in a state of delight, or in a state of intoxication, such as was not incompatible with the character of the ancient gods. Here again the difficulty of rendering Vedic thought in English, or any other modern language, becomes apparent, for we have no poetical word to express a high state of mental excitement produced by drinking the intoxicating juice of the Soma or other plants, which has not something opprobrious mixed up with it, while in ancient times that state of excitement was celebrated as a blessing of the gods, as not unworthy of the gods themselves, nay, as a state in which both the warrior and the poet would perform their highest achievements. The German R a u sc h is the nearest approach to the Sanskrit mada.
VIII, I, 21. vísveshâm tarutâ´ram mada-kyútam máde hí sma dádâti nah.
Indra, the conqueror of all, who rushes about in rapture, for in rapture he bestows gifts upon us. Cf. I, 51, 2.
p. 136
The horses of Indra are called madakyút, I, 81, 3; VIII, 33, 18; 34, 9. Ordinary horses, I, 126, 4.
It is more surprising to see this epithet applied to the Asvins, who are generally represented as moving about with exemplary steadiness. However we read:
VIII, 22, 16. mánah-gavasâ vrishanâ mada-kyutâ.
Ye two Asvins, quick as thought, powerful, wildly moving; or, as Sâyana proposes, liberal givers, humblers of your enemies. See also VIII, 35, 19.
Most frequently madakyút is applied to Soma, X, 30, 9; IX, 32, 1; 53, 4; 79, 2; 108, 11; where particularly the last passage deserves attention, in which Soma is called madakyútam sahásra-dhâram vrishabhám.
Lastly, even the wealth itself which the Maruts are asked to send down from heaven, most likely rain, is called, VIII, 7, 13, rayím mada-kyútam puru-kshúm visvadhâyasam.
In all these passages we must translate mada-kyút by bringing delight, showering down delight.
We have thus arrived at the conclusion that vríshanam mada-kyútam, as used in our passage I, 85, 7, might be meant either for Indra or for Soma. If the Asvins can be called vríshanau mada-kyútâ, the same expression would be even more applicable to Indra. On the other hand, if Soma is called vrishabháh mada-kyút, the same Soma may legitimately be called vríshâ inada-kyút. In deciding whether Indra or Soma be meant, we must now have recourse to other hymns, in which the relations of the Maruts with Vishnu, Soma, and Indra are alluded to.
If Indra were intended, and if the first words meant 'When Vishnu perceived the approach of Indra,' we should expect, not that the Maruts sat down on the sacrificial pile, but that they rushed to the battle. The idea that the Maruts come to the sacrifice, like birds, is common enough:
VIII, 20, 10. vrishanasvéna marutah vrísha-psunâ ráthena vrísha-nâbhinâ, â´ syenâ´sah ná pakshínah vríthâ narah havyâ´ nah vîtáye gata.
Come ye Maruts together, to eat our offerings, on your
p. 137
strong-horsed, strong-shaped, strong-naved chariot, like winged hawks!
But when the Maruts thus come to a sacrifice it is to participate in it, and particularly in the Soma that is offered by the sacrificer. This Soma, it is said in other hymns, was prepared by Vishnu for Indra (II, 22, 1), and Vishnu is said to have brought the Soma for Indra (X, 113, 2). If we keep these and similar passages in mind. and consider that in the preceding verse the Maruts have been invited to sit down on the sacrificial pile and to rejoice in the sweet food, we shall see that the same train of thought is carried on in our verse, the only new idea being that the saving or, possibly, the descrying of the Soma is ascribed to Vishnu. See, however, Bergaigne, Journ. Asiat. 1884, p 472.
Verse 8.
Note 1. On na and iva together, see Bollensen, Orient and Occident, II, 470.
Verse 9.
Note 1. Tváshtar, the workman of the gods, frequently. also the fashioner and creator.
Note 2. Nári, the loc. sing. of nri, but, if so, with a wrong accent, occurs only in this phrase as used here, and as repeated in VIII, 96, 19. nári ápâmsi kártâ sáh vritrahâ´. Its meaning is not clear. It can hardly mean 'on man,' without some more definite application. If nri could be used as a name of Vritra or any other enemy, it would mean, to do his deeds against the man, on the enemy. Nri, however, is ordinarily an honorific term, chiefly applied to Indra, IV, 25, 4. náre náryâya nrí-tamâya nrinâ´m, and hence its application to Vritra would be objectionable. Sâyana explains it in the sense of battle. I believe that nári stands for náryâ, the acc. plur. neut. of nárya, manly, and the frequent epithet of ápas, and I have translated accordingly. Indra is called nárya-apas, VIII, 93, 1. See also Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xxv, p. 601.
Verse 10.
Note 1. Avatá, a well, here meant for cloud, like útsa, I, 64, 6.
p. 138
Note 2. Dhámantah vânám is translated by Sâyana as playing on the lyre, by Benfey as blowing the flute. Such a rendering, particularly the latter, would be very appropriate, but there is no authority for vâná meaning either lyre or flute in the Veda. Vâná occurs five times only. In one passage, VIII, 20, 8. góbhih vânáh agyate, it means arrow; the arrow is sent forth from the bow-strings. The same meaning seems applicable to IX, 50, I. vânásya kodaya pavím. In another passage, IX, 97, 8. prá vadanti vânám, they send forth their voice, is applied to the Maruts, as in our passage; in IV, 24, 9, the sense is doubtful, but here too vâná clearly does not mean a musical instrument. See III, 30, 10. Spiegel compares the Huzvaresh and Armenian vâng (Pers. bânig), voice. M. Senart (Journal Asiatique, 1874, p. 281) is in favour of taking vâna for flute.
Verse 12.
Note 1. In the Taitt. S. I, 5, 11, we have sasamânâya, and in the Taitt. Br. II, 8, 5, 6, samsamânâya, but Sâyana explains sasamânâya, samsanam kurvate. He explains tridhâtûni by asanam, pânam, khâdanam.
Vríshan.
Note 2. In vríshan we have one of those words which it is almost impossible to translate accurately. It occurs over and over again in the Vedic hymns, and if we once know the various ideas which it either expresses or implies, we have little difficulty in understanding its import in a vague and general way, though we look in vain for corresponding terms in any modern language. In the Veda, and in ancient languages generally, one and the same word is frequently made to do service for many. Words retain their general meaning,—though at the same time they are evidently used with a definite purpose. This is not only a peculiar phase of language, but a peculiar phase of thought, and as to us this phase has become strange and unreal, it is very difficult to transport ourselves back into it, still more to translate the pregnant terms of the Vedic poets into the definite languages which we have to use. Let us imagine a state of
p. 139
thought and speech in which virtus still meant manliness, though it might also be applied to the virtue of a woman; or let us try to speak and think a language which expressed the bright and the divine, the brilliant and the beautiful, the straight and the right, the bull and the hero, the shepherd and the king by the same terms, and we shall see how difficult it would be to translate such terms without losing either the key-note that was still sounding, or the harmonics which were set vibrating by it in the minds of the poets and their listeners.
1. Vríshan, male.
Vríshan, being derived from a root vrish, spargere, meant no doubt originally the male, whether applied to animals or men. In this sense vríshan occurs frequently in the Veda, either as determining the sex of the animal which is mentioned, or as standing by itself and meaning the male. In either case, however, it implies the idea of strength and eminence, which we lose whether we translate it by man or male.
Thus ásva is horse, but VII, 69, 1, we read:
â´ vâm ráthah—vrísha-bhih yâtu ásvaih.
May your chariot come near with powerful horses, i. e. with stallions.
The Háris, the horses of Indra, are frequently called vríshanâ
I, 177, 1. yuktvâ´ hárî (iti) vríshanâ.
Having yoked the bay stallions.
Vrishabá, though itself originally meaning the male animal, had become fixed as the name of the bull, and in this process it had lost so much of its etymological import that the Vedic poet did not hesitate to define vrishabhá itself by the addition of vríshan. Thus we find:
VIII, 93, 7. sáh vríshâ vrishabháh bhuvat.
May he (Indra) be a strong bull.
I, 54, 2. vríshâ vrisha-tvâ´ vrishabháh.
Indra by his strength a strong bull; but, literally, Indra by his manliness a male bull.
Even vrishabhá loses again its definite meaning; and as
p. 140
bull in bull-calf means simply male, or in bull-trout, large, so vrishabhá is added to átya, horse, to convey the meaning of large or powerful:
I, 177, 2. yé te vríshanah vrishabhâ´sah indra—átyâh. Thy strong and powerful horses; literally, thy male bull-horses.
When vríshan and vrishabhá are used as adjectives, for instance with súshma, strength, they hardly differ in meaning:
VI, 19, 8. â´ nah bhara vríshanam súshmam indra.
Bring us thy manly strength, O Indra.
And in the next verse:
VI, 19, 9. â´ te súshmah vrishabháh etu.
May thy manly strength come near.
Vámsaga, too, which is clearly the name for bull, is defined by vríshan, I, 7, 8:
vríshâ yûthâ´-iva vámsagah.
As the strong bull scares the herds.
The same applies to varâ´ha, which, though by itself meaning boar, is determined again by vríshan:
X, 67, 7. vrísha-bhih varâ´haih.
With strong boars.
In III, 2, 11, we read:
vríshâ—nâ´nadat ná simháh.
Like a roaring lion.
If used by itself, vríshan, at least in the Rig-veda, can hardly be said to be the name of any special animal, though in later Sanskrit it may mean bull or horse. Thus if we read, X, 43, 8, vríshâ ná kruddháh, we can only translate like an angry male, though, no doubt, like a wild bull, would seem more appropriate.
I, 186, 5. yéna nápâtam apâ´m gunâ´ma manah-gúvah vríshanah yám váhanti.
That we may excite the son of the water (Agni), whom the males, quick as thought, carry along.
Here the males are no doubt the horses or stallions of Agni. But, though this follows from the context, it would be wrong to say that vríshan by itself means horse.
p. 141
If used by itself, vríshan most frequently means man, and chiefly in his sexual character. Thus:
I, 140, 6. vríshâ-iva pátnîh abhí eti róruvat.
Agni comes roaring like a husband to his wives.
I, 179, i. ápi ûm (íti) nú pátnîh vríshanah gagamyuh.
Will the husbands now come to their wives?
II, 16, 8. sakrít sú te sumatí-bhih—sám pátnîbhih ná vríshanah nasîmahi.
May we for once cling firmly to thy blessings, as husbands cling to their wives.
V, 47, 6. upa-prakshé vríshanah módamânâh diváh pathâ´ vadhvãh yanti ákkha.
The exulting men come for the embrace on the path of heaven towards their wives.
In one or two passages vríshan would seem to have a still more definite meaning, particularly in the formula sû´rah drísîke vríshanah ka paûmsye, which occurs IV, 41, 6; X, 92, 7. See also I, 179, 1.
In all the passages which we have hitherto examined vríshan clearly retained its etymological meaning, though even then it was not always possible to translate it by mal e.
The same meaning has been retained in other languages in which this word can be traced. Thus, in Zend, arshan (the later gushan) is used to express the sex of animals in such expressions as aspahé arshnô, gen. a male horse; varâzahe arshnô, gen. a male boar; géus arshnô, gen. a male ox; but likewise in the sense of man or hero, as arsha husrava, the hero Husrava. In Greek we find ἄρσην and ἄῤῥην used in the same way to distinguish the sex of animals, as ἄρσενες ἵπποι, βοῦν ἄρσενα. In Latin the same word may be recognised in the proper name Varro, and in vâro and bâro.
We now come to another class of passages in which vríshan is clearly intended to express more than merely the masculine gender. In some of them the etymological meaning of spargere, to pour forth, seems to come out again, and it is well known that Indian commentators are very fond of explaining vríshan by giver of rain, giver of
p. 142
good gifts, bounteous. The first of these meanings may indeed be admitted in certain passages, but in others it is more than doubtful.
II. Vríshan, fertilising.
I, 181, 8. vríshâ vâm megháh may be translated, your raining cloud.
I, 129, 3. dasmáh hí sma vríshanam pinvasi tvákam.
Thou art strong, thou fillest the rainy skin, i. e. the cloud.
See also IV, 22, 6; and possibly V, 83, 6.
It may be that, when applied to Soma too, vríshan retained something of its etymological meaning, that it meant gushing forth, poured out, though in many places it is impossible to render vríshan, as applied to Soma, by anything but strong. All we can admit is that vríshan, if translated by strong, means also strengthening and invigorating, an idea not entirely absent even in our expression, a strong drink.
III. Vríshan, strong.
I, 80, 2. sáh tvâ amadat vríshâ mádah, sómah—sutáh.
This strong draught inspirited thee, the poured out Soma-juice.
I, 91, 2. tvám vríshâ vrisha-tvébhih.
Thou, Soma, art strong by strength.
I, 175, 1. vríshâ te vríshne índuh vâgî´ sahasra-sâ´tamah.
For thee, the strong one, there is strong drink, powerful, omnipotent.
In the ninth Mandala, specially dedicated to the praises of Soma, the inspiriting beverage of gods and men, the repetition of vríshan, as applied to the juice and to the god who drinks it, is constant. Indo vríshâ or vríshâ indo are incessant invocations, and become at last perfectly meaningless.
IV. Vríshan, epitheton ornans.
There can be no doubt, in fact, that already in the hymns of the Veda, vríshan had dwindled away to a mere epitheton ornans, and that in order to understand it correctly, we must, as much as possible, forget its etymological
p. 143
colouring, and render it by hero or strong. Indra, Agni, the Asvins, Vishnu, the Ribhus (IV, 35, 6), all are vríshan, which means no longer male, but manly, strong.
In the following passages vríshan is thus applied to Indra:
I, 54, 2. yáh dhrishnúnâ sávasâ ródasî (íti) ubhé (íti) vríshâ vrisha-tvâ´ vrishabháh ni-riñgáte.
(Praise Indra) who by his daring strength conquers both heaven and earth, a bull, strong in strength.
I, 100, 1. sáh yáh vríshâ vríshnyebhih sám-okâh maháh diváh prithivyâ´h ka sam-râ´t satîná-satvâ hávyah bháreshu marûtvân nah bhavatu índrah ûtî´.
He who is strong, wedded to strength, who is the king of the great sky and the earth, of mighty might, to be invoked in battles,—may Indra with the Maruts come to our help!
I, 16, 1. â´ tvâ vahantu hárayah vríshanam sóma-pîtaye, Indra tvâ sû´ra-kakshasah.
May the bays bring thee hither, the strong one, to the Soma-draught, may the sunny-eyed horses (bring) thee, O Indra!
IV, 16, 20. evá ít índrâya vrishabhâ´ya vríshne bráhma akarma bhrígavah ná rátham.
Thus we have made a hymn for Indra, the strong bull, as the Bhrigus make a chariot.
X, 153, 2. tvám vrishan vríshâ ít asi.
Thou, O hero, art indeed a hero; and not, Thou, O male, art indeed a male; still less, Thou, O bull, art indeed a bull.
I, 101, 1. avasyávah vríshanam vágra-dakshinam marútvantam sakhyâ´ya havâmahe.
Longing for help we call as our friend the hero who wields the thunderbolt, who is accompanied by the Maruts.
VIII, 6, 14. ní súshne indra dharnasím vágram gaghantha dásyavi, vríshâ hí ugra srinvishé.
Thou, O Indra, hast struck the strong thunderbolt against Sushna, the fiend; for, terrible one, thou art called hero!
VIII, 6, 40. vavridhânáh ûpa dyávi vríshâ vagrî´ aroravît, vritra-hâ´ soma-pâ´tamah.
p. 144
Growing up by day, the hero with the thunderbolt has roared, the Vritra-killer, the great Soma-drinker.
V, 35, 4. vríshâ hí ási râ´dhase gagñishé vríshni te sávah.
Thou (Indra) art a hero, thou wast born to be bounteous; in thee, the hero, there is might.
V. Várshishtha, strongest, best, oldest.
It is curious to watch the last stage of the meaning of vríshan in the comparative and superlative várshîyas and várshishtha. In the Veda, várshishtha still means excellent, but in later Sanskrit it is considered as the superlative of vriddha, old, so that we see vríshan, from meaning originally manly, vigorous, young, assuming in the end the meaning of old. (M. M., Sanskrit Grammar, § 252.)
Yet even thus, when vríshan means simply strong or hero, its sexual sense is not always forgotten, and it breaks out, for instance, in such passages as,
I, 32, 7. vríshnah vádhrih prati-mâ´nam búbhûshan purutrâ´ vritráh asayat ví-astah.
Vritra, the eunuch, trying to be like unto a man (like unto Indra), was lying, broken to many pieces.
The next passages show vríshan as applied to Agni:
III, 27, 15. vríshanam tvâ vayám vrishan vríshanah sám idhîmahi.
O, strong one, let us the strong ones kindle thee, the strong!
V, I, 12. ávokâma kaváye médhyâya vákah vandâ´ru vrishabhâ´ya vríshne.
We have spoken an adoring speech for the worshipful poet, for the strong bull (Agni).
Vishnu is called vríshan, I, 154, 3:
prá víshnave sûshám etu mánma giri-kshíte uru-gâyâ´ya vríshne.
May this hymn go forth to Vishnu, he who dwells in the mountain""(cloud), who strides wide, the hero!
Rudra is called vríshan:
II, 34, 2. rudráh yát vah marutah rukma-vakshasah vríshâ ágani prísnyah sukré û´dhani.
When Rudra, the strong man, begat you, O Maruts with
p. 145
bright ornaments on your chests, in the bright lap of Prisni.
That the Maruts, the sons of Rudra, are called vríshan, we have seen before, and shall see frequently again (I, 165, 1; II, 33, 13; VII, 56, 20; 21; 58, 6). The whole company of the Maruts is called vríshâ ganáh, the strong or manly host, i. e. the host of the Maruts, without any further qualification.
VI. Vríshan, name of various deities.
Here lies, indeed, the chief difficulty which is raised by the common use of vríshan in the Veda, that when it occurs by itself, it often remains doubtful who is meant by it, Indra, or Soma, or the Maruts, or some other deity. We shall examine a few of these passages, and first some where vríshan refers to Indra:
IV, 30, 10. ápa ushâ´h ánasah sarat sám-pishtât áha bibhyúshî, ní yát sîm sisnáthat vríshâ.
Ushas went away from her broken chariot, fearing lest the hero should do her violence.
Here vríshan is clearly meant for Indra, who, as we learn from the preceding verse, was trying to conquer Ushas, as Apollo did Daphne; and it should be observed that the word itself, by which Indra is here designated, is particularly appropriate to the circumstances.
I, 103, 6. bhû´ri-karmane vrishabhâ´ya vríshne satyá-sushmâya sunavâma sómam, yáh â-drítya paripanthî´-iva sû´rah áyagvanah vi-bhágan éti védah.
Let us pour out the Soma for the strong bull, the performer of many exploits, whose strength is true, the hero who, watching like a footpad, comes to us dividing the wealth of the infidel.
Here it is clear again from the context that Indra only can be meant.
But in other passages this is more doubtful:
III, 61, 7. ritásya budhné ushásâm ishanyán vríshâ mahî´ (íti) ródasî (íti) â´ vivesa.
The hero in the depth of the heaven, yearning for the dawns, has entered the great sky and the earth.
p. 146
The hero who yearns for the dawns, is generally Indra; here, however, considering that Agni is mentioned in the preceding verse, it is more likely that this god, as the light of the morning, may have been meant by the poet. That Agni, too, may be called vríshan, without any other epithet to show that he is meant rather than any other god, is clear from such passages as,
VI, 3, 7. vríshâ ruksháh óshadhîshu nûnot.
He the wild hero shouted among the plants.
In VII, 60, 9, vrishanau, the dual, is meant for Mitra and Varuna; in the next verse, vrishanah, the plural, must mean the same gods and their companions.
That Soma is called simply vríshan, not only in the ninth Mandala, but elsewhere, too, we see from such passages as,
III, 43, 7. índra píba vrísha-dhûtasya vríshnah (â´ yám te syenáh usaté gabhâ´ra), yásya máde kyaváyasi prá, krishtî´h yásya máde ápa gotrâ´ vavártha.
Indra drink of the male (the strong Soma), bruised by the males (the heavy stones), inspirited by whom thou makest the people fall down, inspirited by whom thou hast opened the stables.
Here Sâyana, too, sees rightly that 'the male bruised by the males' is the Soma-plant, which, in order to yield the intoxicating juice, has to be bruised by stones, which stones are again likened to two males. But unless the words, enclosed in brackets, had stood in the text, words which clearly point to Soma, I doubt whether Sâyana would have so readily admitted the definite meaning of vríshan as Soma.
I, 109, 3. mâ´ khedma rasmî´n íti nâ´dhamânâh pitrînâ´m saktî´h anu-yákkhamânâh, indrâgní-bhyâm kám vríshanah madanti tâ´ hí ádrî (íti) dhishánâyâh upá-sthe.
We pray, let us not break the cords (which, by means of the sacrifices offered by each generation of our forefathers, unite us with the gods); we strive after the powers of our fathers. The Somas rejoice for Indra and Agni; for the two stones are in the lap of the vessel.
First, as to the construction, the fact that participles are thus used as finite verbs, and particularly when the subject changes in the next sentence, is proved by other passages,
p. 147
such as II, 11, 4. The sense is that the new generation does not break the sacrificial succession, but offers Soma, like their fathers. The Soma-plants are ready, and, when pressed by two stones, their juice flows into the Soma-vessel. There may be a double entendre in dhishánâyâh upá-sthe, which Sanskrit scholars will easily perceive.
When vríshan is thus used by itself, we must be chiefly guided by the adjectives or other indications before we determine on the most plausible translation. Thus we read:
I, 55, 4. sáh ít váne namasyú-bhih vakasyate kâ´ru gáneshu pra-bruvânáh indriyám, vríshâ khánduh bhavati haryatáh vríshâ kshémena dhénâm maghá-vâ yát ínvati.
In the first verse the subject may be Indra or Soma: 'He alone is praised by worshippers in the forest (or in the wooden vessel), he who shows forth among men his fair power.' But who is meant to be the subject of the next verse? Even Sâyana is doubtful. He translates first: 'The bounteous excites the man who wishes to sacrifice; when the sacrificer, the rich, by the protection of Indra, stirs up his voice.' But he allows an optional translation for the last sentences: when the powerful male, Indra, by his enduring mind reaches the praise offered by the sacrificer.'
According to these suggestions, Wilson translated: He (Indra) is the granter of their wishes (to those who solicit him); he is the encourager of those who desire to worship (him), when the wealthy offerer of oblations, enjoying his protection, recites his praise.
Benfey: The bull becomes friendly, the bull becomes desirable, when the sacrificer kindly advances praise.
Langlois: When the noble Maghavan receives the homage of our hymns, his heart is flattered, and he responds to the wishes of his servant by his gifts.
As far as I know, the adjective khándu does not occur again, and can therefore give us no hint. But haryatá, which is applied to vríshan in our verse, is the standing epithet of Soma. It means delicious, and occurs very frequently in the ninth Mandala. It is likewise applied. to Agni, Pûshan, the Haris, the thunderbolt, but wherever
p. 148
it occurs our first thought is of Soma. Thus, without quoting from the Soma-Mandala, we read, X, 96, 1, haryatám mádam, the delicious draught, i. e. Soma.
X, 96, 9. pîtvâ´ mádasya haryatásya ándhasah, means having drunk of the draught of the delicious Soma.
VIII, 72, 18. padám haryatásya ni-dhânyâ´m, means the place where the delicious Soma resides.
III, 44, 1. haryatáh sómah.
Delicious Soma.
II, 21, 1. bhara índrâya sómam yagatâ´ya haryatám.
Bring delicious Soma for the holy Indra.
I, 130, 2. mádâya haryatâ´ya te tuvíh-tamaya dhâ´yase.
That thou mayest drink the delicious and most powerful draught, i. e. the Soma.
If, then, we know that vríshan by itself is used in the sense of Soma, haryatá vríshan can hardly be anything else. Vakasyate also is peculiar to Soma in the sense of murmuring, or as it were talking, .and never occurs as a passive. I therefore should prefer to assign the whole verse to Soma, and translate: He indeed, when in the wooden vessel, talks with his worshippers, proclaiming his fair power among men; the strong Soma is pleasing, the strong Soma is delicious, when the sacrificer safely brings the cow, i. e. the milk to be mixed with the Soma.
That Indra was thirsting for Soma had been said in the second verse, and he is again called the Soma-drinker in the seventh verse. A verse dedicated to Soma therefore seems to come in quite naturally, though the Anukramanî does not sanction it.
That the Maruts are called vríshan, without further explanations, will appear from the following passages:
I, 85, 12. rayím nah dhatta vrishanah su-vî´ram.
Give us wealth, ye heroes, consisting of good offspring.
VIII, 96, 14. íshyâmi vah vrishanah yúdhyata âgaú.
I wish for you, heroes (Maruts), fight in the race!
In all the passages which we have hitherto examined, vríshan was always applied to living beings, whether animals, men, or gods. But as, in Greek, ἄρσην means at last simply strong, and is applied, for instance, to the
p. 149
crash of the sea, κτύπος ἄρσην πόντου, so in the Veda vríshan is applied to the roaring of the storms and similar objects.
V, 87, 5. svanáh vríshâ.
Your powerful sound (O Maruts).
X, 47, 1. gagribhmá te dákshinam indra hástam vasuyávah vasu-pate vásûnâm, vidmá hí tvâ gó-patim sûra gónâm asmábhyam kitrám vríshanam rayím dâh.
We have taken thy right hand, O Indra, wishing for treasures, treasurer of treasures, for we know thee, O hero, to be the lord of cattle; give us bright and strong wealth.
Should kitrá here refer to treasures, and vríshan to cattle?
X, 89, 9. ní amítreshu vadhám indra túmram vríshan vríshanam arushám sisîhi.
Whet, O hero, the heavy strong red weapon against the enemies.
The long â in vríshanam is certainly startling, but it occurs once more, IX, 34, 3, where there can be no doubt that it is the accusative of vríshan. Professor Roth takes vríshan here in the sense of bull (s. v. tumra), but he does not translate the whole passage.
III, 29, 9. krinóta dhûmám vríshanam sakhâyah.
Make a mighty smoke, O friends!
Strength itself is called vríshan, if I am right in translating the phrase vríshanam súshmam by manly strength. It occurs,
IV, 24, 7. tásmin dadhat vríshanam súshmam índrah.
Indra may give to him manly strength.
VI, 19, 8. â´ nah bhara vríshanam súshmam indra.
Bring to us, O Indra, manly strength.
VII, 24, 4. asmé (íti) dádhat vríshanam súshmam indra.
Giving to us, O Indra, manly strength.
See also VI, 19, 9, súshmah vrishabháh, used in the same sense.
VII. Vríshan, general and empty term of praise.
This constant play on the word vríshan, which we have observed in the passages hitherto examined, and which give by no means a full idea of the real frequency of its
p. 150
occurrence in the Veda, has evidently had its influence on the Vedic Rishis, who occasionally seem to delight in the most silly and unmeaning repetitions of this word, and its compounds and derivatives. Here no language can supply any adequate translation; for though we may translate words which express thoughts, it is useless to attempt to render mere idle play with words. I shall give a few instances:
I, 177, 3. â´ tishtha rátham vríshanam vríshâ te sutáh sómah pári-siktâ mádhûni, yuktvâ´ vrísha-bhyâm vrishabha kshitînâ´m hári-bhyâm yâhi pra-vátâ úpa madrík.
Mount the strong car, the strong Soma is poured out for thee, sweets are sprinkled round; come down towards us, thou bull of men, with the strong bays, having yoked them.
But this is nothing yet compared to other passages, when the poet cannot get enough of vríshan and vrishabhá.
II, 16, 6. vríshâ te vágrah utá te vríshâ ráthah vríshanâ hárî (íti) vrishabhâ´ni â´yudhâ, vríshnah mádasya vrishabha tvám îsishe indra sómasya vrishabhásya tripnuhi.
Thy thunderbolt is strong, and thy car is strong, strong are the bays, the weapons are powerful, thou, bull, art lord of the strong draught, Indra rejoice in the powerful Soma!
V, 36, 5. vríshâ tvâ vríshanam vardhatu dyaúh vríshâ vrísha-bhyâm vahase hári-bhyâm, sáh nah vríshâ vrísharathah su-sipra vrísha-krato (iti) vríshâ vagrin bháre dhâh.
May the strong sky increase thee, the strong; a strong one thou art, carried by two strong bays; do thou who art strong, with a strong car, O thou of strong might, strong holder of the thunderbolt, keep us in battle!
V, 40, 2-3. vríshâ grâ´vâ vríshâ mádah vríshâ sómah ayám sutáh, vríshan indra vrísha-bhih vritrahan-tama, vríshâ tvâ vríshanam huve.
The stone is strong, the draught is strong, this Soma that has been poured out is strong, O thou strong Indra, who killest Vritra with the strong ones (the Maruts), I, the strong, call thee, the strong.
VIII, 13, 31-33. vríshâ ayám indra te ráthah utó (íti) te
p. 151
vríshanâ hárî (íti), vríshâ tvám sata-krato (íti) vríshâ hávah. vríshâ grâ´vâ vríshâ mádah vríshâ sómah ayám sutáh, vríshâ yagñáh yám ínvasi vríshâ hávah. vríshâ tvâ vríshanam huve vágrin kitrâ´bhih ûtí-bhih, vavántha hí práti-stutim vríshâ hávah.
This thy car is strong, O Indra, and thy bays are strong; thou art strong, O omnipotent, our call is strong. The stone is strong, the draught is strong, the Soma is strong, which is here poured out; the sacrifice which thou orderest is strong, our call is strong. I, the strong, call thee, the strong, thou holder of the thunderbolt, with manifold blessings; for thou hast desired our praise; our call is strong.
There are other passages of the same kind, but they are too tedious to be here repeated. The commentator, throughout, gives to each vríshan its full meaning either of showering down or bounteous, or male or-bull; but a word which can thus be used at random has clearly lost its definite power, and cannot call forth any definite ideas in the mind of the listener. It cannot be denied that here and there the original meaning of vríshan would be appropriate even where the poet is only pouring out a stream of majestic sound, but we are not called upon to impart sense to what are verba et praeterquam nihil. When we read, I, 122, 3, vâ´tah apâ´m vrishan-vân, we are justified, no doubt, in translating, 'the wind who pours forth water;' and X, 93, 5, apâ´m vrishan-vasû (íti) sû´ryâmâ´sâ, means 'Sun and Moon, givers of water.' But even in some passages where vríshan is followed by the word vrish, it is curious to observe that vrish is not necessarily used in the sense of raining or pouring forth, but rather in the sense of drinking.
VI, 68, 11. índrâvarunâ mádhumat-tamasya vríshnah sómasya vrishanâ a â´ vrishethâm.

p. 152
Indra and Varuna, you strong ones, may you drink of the sweetest strong Soma.
That â-vrish means to drink or to eat, was known to Sâyana and to the author of the Satapatha-brâhmana, who paraphrases â vrishâyadhvam by asnîta, eat.
The same phrase occurs I, 108, 3.
I, 104, 9. uru-vyákâh gatháre â´ vrishasva.
Thou of vast extent, drink (the Soma) in thy stomach.
The same phrase occurs X, 96, 13.
VIII, 61, 3. â´ vrishasva—sutásya indra ándhasah.
Drink, Indra, of the Soma that is poured out.
In conclusion, a few passages may be pointed out in which vríshan seems to be the proper name of a pious worshipper:
I, 36, 10. yám tvâ devâ´sah mánave dadhúh ihá yágishtham havya-vâhana, yám kânvah médhya-atithih dhanasprítam yám vríshâ yám upa-stutáh.
Thee, O Agni, whom the gods placed here for man, the most worthy of worship, O carrier of oblations, thee whom Kanva, thee whom Medhyâtithi placed, as the giver of wealth, thee whom Vrishan placed and Upastuta.
Here the commentator takes Vrishan as Indra, but this would break the symmetry of the sentence. That Upastutáh is here to be taken as a proper name, as Upastuta, the son of Vrishtihavya, is clear from verse 17:
agníh pra âvat mitrâ´ utá médhya-atithim agníh sâtâ´ upastutám.
Agni protected also the two friends, Medhyâtithi and Upastuta, in battle.
The fact is that whenever upastutá has the accent on the last syllable, it is intended as a proper name, while, if used as a participle, in the sense of praised, it has the accent on the first.
p. 153
VIII, 5, 25. yáthâ kit kánvam â´vatam priyá-medham upa-stutám.
As you have protected Kanva, Priyamedha, Upastutá. Cf. I, 112, 15.
VIII, 103, 8. prá mámhishthâya gâyata—úpa-stutâsah agnáye (accent of the vocative).
Sing, O Upastutás, to the worthiest, to Agni!
X, 115, 9. íti tvâ agne vrishti-hávyasya putrâ´h upastutâ´sah ríshayah avokan.
By these names, O Agni, did the sons of Vrishtihavya, the Upastutás, the Rishis, speak to you.
Vrishan occurs once more as a proper name in VI, 16, 14 and 15:
tám ûm (íti) tvâ dadhyáṅ ríshih putráh îdhe átharvanah, vritra-hánam puram-darám.
tám ûm (íti) tvâ pâthyáh vríshâ sám îdhe dasyuhántamam, dhanam-gayám ráne-rane.
Thee, O Agni, did Dadhyak kindle, the Rishi, the son of Atharvan, thee the killer of Vritra, the destroyer of towns;
Thee, O Agni, did Vrishan Pâthya kindle, thee the best killer of enemies, the conqueror of wealth in every battle.
Here the context can leave no doubt that Dadhyak and Vrishan were both intended as proper names. Yet as early as the composition of the Satapatha-brâhmana, this was entirely misunderstood. Dadhyak, the son of Atharvan, is explained as speech, Vrishan Pâthya as mind (Sat. Br. VI, 3, 3, 4). On this Mahidhara, in his remarks on Vâg. Samh. XI, 34, improves still further. For though he allows his personality to Dadhyak, the son of Atharvan, he says that Pâthya comes from pathin, path, and means he who moves on the right path; or it comes from pâthas, which means sky, and is here used in the sense of the sky of the heart. He then takes vrishan as mind, and translates the mind of the heart. Such is a small chapter in the history of the rise and fall of the Indian mind!
"
12,"MANDALA I, HYMN 86.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 6, VARGA 11-12.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. O Maruts, that man in whose dwelling you drink (the Soma), ye mighty (sons) of heaven, he indeed has the best guardians 1.
2. You who are propitiated 1 either by sacrifices or from the prayers of the sage, hear the call, O Maruts!
3. Aye, the powerful man to whom you have granted a sage, he will live in a stable rich in cattle 1.
4. On the altar of this strong man (here) 1 Soma is poured out in daily sacrifices; praise and joy are sung.
5. To him let the mighty 1 Maruts listen, to him who surpasses all men, as the flowing rain-clouds 2 pass over the sun.

NOTES.
This hymn is ascribed to Gotama.
Verse 1 =VS. VIII, 31; AV. XX, 1, 2; TS. IV, 2, 11, 1.
Verse 2=TS. IV, 2, 11, 2.
Verse 6=TS. IV, 3, 13, 5.
Verse 8= SV. II, 944.
Verse 1.
Note 1. Vímahas occurs only once more as an epithet of the Maruts, V, 87, 4. Being an adjective derived from máhas, strength, it means very strong. The strong ones of heaven is an expression analogous to I, 64, 2. diváh rishvâ´sah ukshánah; I, 64, 4. diváh nárah. The Ait. Brâhmana VI, 10, takes gopâ, guardian, as Indra.
Verse 2.
Note 1. The construction of this verse is not clear. Yagñá-vâhas has two meanings in the Veda. It is applied to the priest who carries or performs the sacrifice:
III, 8, 3, and 24, 1. várkah dhâh yagñá-vâhase.
Grant splendour to the sacrificer!
But it is also used of the gods who carry off the sacrifice, and in that case it means hardly more than worshipped or propitiated; I, 15, 11 (Asvinau); IV, 47, 4 (Indra and Vâyu); VIII, 12, 20 (Indra). In our verse it is used in the latter sense, and it is properly construed with the instrumental yagñaíh. The difficulty is the gen. plur. matînâ´m, instead of matíbhih. The sense, however, seems to allow of but one construction, and we may suppose that the genitive depends on the yagña in yagñávâhas, 'accepting the worship of the prayers of the priest.' Benfey refers yagñaíh to the preceding verse, and joins hávam to víprasya matînâ´m: 'Durch Opfer—Opferfördrer ihr!—oder ihr hört—Maruts—den Ruf der Lieder, die der Priester schuf.'
The Samhitâ text lengthens the last syllable of srinutá, as suggested by the metre.
p. 156
If the accent allowed yagñavâhasah to be taken as a genitive, the translation, as suggested by Ludwig, might be, Either for the sake of the sacrifices of the sacrificer, or because of the prayers of the sage, O Maruts, hear the call.'
Verse 3.
Note 1. The genitive yásya vâgínah depends on vípra. Anu-taksh, like anu-grah, anu-gñâ, seems to convey the meaning of doing in behalf or for the benefit of a person. Gántâ might also be translated in a hostile sense, he will go into, he will conquer many a stable full of cows.
Verse 4.
Note 1. Ludwig has pointed out that asyá may refer to the present sacrificer.
Verse 5.
Note 1. I have altered â´ bhúvah into âbhúvah, for I do not think that bhuvah, the second pers. sing., even if it were bhúvat, the third pers., could be joined with the relative pronoun yáh in the second pada. The phrase vísvâh yáh karshanî´h abhí occurs more than once, and is never preceded by the verb bhuvah or bhuvat. Âbhúvah, on the contrary, is applied to the Maruts, I, 64, 6, vidátheshu âbhúvah; and as there can be no doubt who are the deities invoked, âbhúvah, the strong ones, is as appropriate an epithet as vímahas in the first verse.
Note 2. Sasrúshîh íshah, as connected with sûra, the sun, can only be meant for the flowing waters, the rain-clouds, the givers of ish or vigour. They are called divyâ´h íshah:
VIII, 5, 21. utá nah divyâ´h íshah utá síndhûn varshathah.
You rain down on us the heavenly waters and the rivers.
Wilson translates: May the Maruts, victorious over all men, hear (the praises) of this (their worshipper); and may (abundant) food be obtained by him who praises them.
Benfey: Ihn, der ob allen Menschen ragt, sollen hören die Labungen, and nahn, die irgend Weisen nahn.
Ludwig: Hören sollen von ihm, der über allen menschen ist, die erden, seine bis zur sonne gelangten kräfte. In his
p. 157
notes he would prefer: Von ihm sollen sie gegenwartig hören, von ihm der alle menschen übertrift (und die in die sonne wegegangenen), die darbringungen.
Sroshantu does not occur again; but we find sróshan, I, 68, 5; sróshamâna, III, 8, 10; VII, 51, 1; VII, 7, 6.
Verse 6.
Note 1. The expression ávobhih, with the help, the blessings, the mercies, is generally used with reference to divine assistance; (I, 117, 19; 167, 2; 185, 10; 11; IV, 22, 7; 41, 6; V, 74, 6; VI, 47, 12; VII, 20, 1; 35, 1, &c.) It seems best therefore to take karshaní as a name or epithet of the Maruts, although, after the invocation of the Maruts by name, this repetition is somewhat unusual. I should have preferred, 'with the help of our men, of our active and busy companions,' for karshaní is used in that sense also. Only ávobhih would not be in its right place then. The same applies to the various reading in TS. IV, 3, 13, 5, where instead of ávobhih we find máhobhih. This too is used with reference to gods, and particularly to the Maruts; see I, 165, 5, note.
Verse 7.
Note 1. Par, with ati, means to carry over (I, 97, 8; 99, I; 174, 9; III, 15, 3; 20, 4; IV, 39, I; V, 25, 9; 73, 8; VII, 40, 4; 97, 4; VIII, 26, 5; 67, 2, &c.); with apa, to remove (I, 129, 5); with nih, to throw down. Hence, if used by itself, unless it means to overrun, as frequently, it can only have the general sense of carrying, taking, accepting, or accomplishing.
Verse 8.
Note 1. Vidá as second pers. plur. perf. is frequent, generally with the final 'a' long in the Samhitâ, I, 156, 3; V, 41, 13; 55, 2.
Verse 9.
Note 1. Observe the long penultimate in rákshah, instead of the usual short syllable. Cf. I, 12, 5, and see Kuhn, Beiträge, vol. iii, p. 456.
p. 158
Verse 10.
Note 1. See note 1 to I, 39, 3.
Note 2. Atrín, which stands for attrín, is one of the many names assigned to the powers of darkness and mischief. It is derived from atrá, which means tooth or jaw, and therefore meant originally an ogre with large teeth or jaws, a devourer. Besides atrá, we also find in the Veda átra, with the accent on the first syllable, and meaning what serves for eating, or food:
X, 79, 2. átrâni asmai pat-bhíh sám bharanti.
They bring together food for him (Agni) with their feet.
With the accent on the last syllable, atrá in one passage means an eater or an ogre, like atrín:
V, 32, 8. apâ´dam atrám—mridhrá-vâkam.
Indra killed the footless ogre, the babbler.
It means tooth or jaw:
I, 129, 8. svayám sâ´ rishayádhyai yâ´ nah upa-îshé atraíh.
May she herself go to destruction who attacks us with her teeth.
It is probably from atrá in the sense of tooth (cf. ὀδόντες = ἐδόντες) that atrín is derived, meaning ogre or a devouring devil. In the later Sanskrit, too, the Asuras are represented as having large tusks, Mahâbh. V, 3572, damshtrino bhîmavegâs ka.
Thus we read I, 21, 5, that Indra and Agni destroy the Rakshas, and the poet continues:
ápragâh santu atrínah.
May the ogres be without offspring!
IX, 86, 48. gahí vísvân rakshásah indo (íti) atrínah.
Kill, O Soma, all the tusky Rakshas. Cf. IX, 104, 6; 105, 6.
VI, 51, 14. gahí ní atrínam paním.
Kill, O Soma, the tusky Pani.
I, 94, 9. vadhaíh duh-sámsân ápa duh-dhyãh gahi
         dûré vâ yé ánti vâ ké kit atrínah.
Strike with thy blows, O Agni, the evil-spoken, evil-minded (spirits), the ogres, those who are far or who are near.
See also I, 36, 14; 20; VI, 16, 28; VII, 104, 1; 5; VIII, 12, 1; 19, 15; X, 36, 4; 118, 1.

"
13,"MANDALA I, HYMN 87.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 6, VARGA 13.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. Endowed with exceeding vigour and power, the singers, the never flinching, the immovable, the impetuous, the most beloved and most manly, have decked themselves with their glittering ornaments, a few only 1, like the heavens with the stars,

Verse 1.
Note 1. Ké kit refers to the Maruts, who are represented as gradually rising or just showing themselves, as yet only few in number, like the first stars in the sky. Ké kit, some, is opposed to sarve, all. The same expression occurs again, V, 52, 12, where the Maruts are compared to a few thieves. B. and R., and those who follow them, translate usrâ´h iva strí-bhih by 'like cows marked with stars on their foreheads.' Such cows no doubt exist, but they can hardly be said to become visible by these frontal stars, as the Maruts by their ornaments. We must take usrâ´h here in the same sense as dyâ´vah; II, 34, 2, it is said that the Maruts were perceived dyâ´vah ná strí-bhih, like the heavens with the stars.
I, 166, 11. dûre-drísah yé divyâ´h-iva strí-bhih.
Who are visible far away, like the heavens (or heavenly beings) by the stars.
And the same is said of Agni, II, 2, 5. dyaúh ná stríbhih kitayat ródasî (íti) ánu. Stríbhih occurs I, 68, 5; IV, 7, 3; VI, 49, 3; 12. It always means stars, and the meaning of rays (strahl) rests, as yet, on etymological authority only. The evening sky would, no doubt, be more appropriate than usrâ´h, which applies chiefly to the dawn. But in the Indian mind, the two dawns, i. e. the dawn and the gloaming, are so closely united and identified, that their names, too, are frequently interchangeable.
Verse 2.
Note 1. I translate yayí not by a goer, a traveller, i. e. the
p. 161
cloud (this is the explanation proposed by Sâyana, and adopted by Professor Benfey), but by path. Sâyana (TS. IV, 3, 13, 7) renders yayim by gatim. Etymologically yayí may mean either, and in some passages I feel doubtful as to which is the more appropriate meaning. But in parallel passages yayí is clearly replaced by yâ´ma. Thus:
VIII, 7, 2. yát—yâ´mam subhrâh ákidhvam.
When you, bright Maruts, have seen your way.
See also VIII, 7, 4. yát yâ´mam yâ´nti vâyú-bhih.
When they (the Maruts) go on their path with the winds.
VIII, 7, 14. ádhi-iva yát girînâ´m yâ´mam subhrâh ákidhvam.
When you, bright Maruts, had seen your way, as it were, from above the mountains.
The same phrase occurs, even without yâ´ma or yayí, in
V, 55, 7. ná párvatâh ná nadyâ´h varanta vah yátra ákidhvam marutah gákkhata ít u tát.
Not mountains, not rivers, keep you back; where you have seen (your way), there you go.
Though yayí does not occur frequently in the Rig-veda, the meaning of path seems throughout more applicable than that of traveller.
V, 87, 5. tvesháh yayíh.
Your path, O Maruts, is blazing.
V, 73, 7. ugráh vâm kakuháh yayíh.
Fearful is your pass on high.
I, 51, 11. ugráh yayim níh apáh srótasâ asrigat.
The fearful Indra sent the waters forth on their way streaming.
X, 92, 5. prá—yayínâ yanti síndhavah.
The waters go forth on their path.
Ludwig takes kósa as buckets on the chariots of the Maruts, which seems right.
Verse 3.
Note 1. Cf. I, 37, 8, page 75. There is no authority for Sâyana's explanation of vithurâ´-iva, the earth trembles like a widow. Vithurâ´ occurs several times in the Rig-veda, but never in the sense of widow. Thus:
p. 162
I, 168, 6. yát kyaváyatha vithurâ´-iva sám-hitam.
When you, Maruts, throw down what is compact, like brittle things.
I, 186, 2; VI, 25, 3; 46, 6; VIII, 96, 2; X, 77, 4 (vithuryáti). The Maruts themselves are called ávithura in verse 1. Spiegel compares the Zend aiwithura. As to ágma and yâ´ma, see I, 37, 8, page 75.
Note 2. Súbh is one of those words to which it is very difficult always to assign a definite special meaning. Being derived from subh, to shine, the commentator has no difficulty in explaining it by splendour, beauty; sometimes by water. But although súbh means originally splendour, and is used in that sense in many passages, yet there are others where so vague a meaning seems very inappropriate. In our verse Sâyana proposes two translations, either, 'When the Maruts harness the clouds,' or, 'When the Maruts harness their chariots, for the bright rain-water.' Now the idea that the Maruts harness their chariots in order to make the clouds yield their rain, can hardly be expressed by the simple word subhé, i. e. for brightness' sake. As the Maruts are frequently praised for their glittering ornaments, their splendour might be intended in this passage, as it certainly is in others. Thus:
I, 85, 3. yát subháyante añgí-bhih tanû´shu subhrâ´h dadhire virúkmatah.
When the Maruts adorn themselves with glittering ornaments, the brilliant ones put bright weapons on their bodies.
VII, 56, 6. subhâ´ sóbhishthâh, sriyâ´ sám-mislâh, ógah-bhih ugrâ´h.
The most brilliant by their brilliancy, united with beauty, terrible by terrors.
In I, 64, 4, I have translated vákshah-su rukmâ´n ádhi yetire subhé by 'they fix gold (chains) on their chests for beauty.' And the same meaning is applicable to I, 117, 5, subhé rukmám ná darsatám ní-khâtam, and other passages: IV, 51, 6; VI, 63, 6.
But in our verse and others which we shall examine, beauty and brilliancy would be very weak renderings for
p. 163
subhé. 'When they harnessed their chariots or their deer for the sake of beauty,' means nothing, or, at least, very little. I take, therefore, subhé in this and similar phrases in the sense of triumph or glory or victory. 'When they harness their chariots for to conquer,' implies brilliancy, glory, victory, but it conveys at the same time a tangible meaning. Let us now see whether the same meaning is appropriate in other passages:
I, 23, 11. gáyatâm-iva tanyatuh marútâm eti dhrishnuyâ´ yát súbham yâthána narah.
The thundering voice of the Maruts comes fiercely, like that of conquerors, when you go to conquer, O men!
Sâyana: 'When you go to the brilliant place of sacrifice.' Wilson: 'When you accept the auspicious (offering).' Benfey: 'Wenn ihr euren Schmuck nehmt.'
V, 57, 2. yâthana súbham, you go to conquer. Cf. V, 55, 1.
Sâyana: 'For the sake of water, or, in a chariot.'
V, 52, 8. sárdhah mâ´rutam út samsa—utá sma té subhe nárah prá syandrâ´h yugata tmánâ.
Praise the host of the Maruts, whether they, the men, the quickly moving, have by themselves harnessed (the chariots) for conquest.
Sâyana: 'For the sake of water.' Cf. X, 105, 3.
V, 57, 3. subhé yát ugrâh príshatîh áyugdhvam.
When you have harnessed the deer for conquest.
Sâyana: 'For the sake of water.'
III, 26, 4. subhé—píshatîh ayukshata.
They had harnessed the deer for victory.
Sâyana: 'They had harnessed in the water the deer together (with the fires).'
V, 63, 5. rátham yuñgate marútah subhé su-khám sû´rah ná—gó-ishtishu.
The Maruts harness the chariot meet for conquest, like a hero in battles.
Sâyana: 'For the sake of water.'
I, 88, 2. subhé kám yânti—ásvaih.
The Maruts go on their horses towards conquest.
Sâyana: 'In order to brighten the worshipper, or, for the sake of water.'
p. 164
I, 119, 3. sám yát mitháh paspridhânâ´sah ágmata subhé makhâ´h ámitâh gâyávah ráne.
When striving with each other they came together, for the sake of glory, the brisk (Maruts), immeasurable (in strength), panting for victory in the fight.
Sâyana: 'For the sake of brilliant wealth.'
VII, 82, 5. marút-bhih ugráh súbham anyáh îyate.
The other, the fearful (Indra), goes with the Maruts to glory.
Sâyana: 'He takes brilliant decoration.'
I, 167, 6. â´ asthâpayanta yuvatím yúvânah subhé nímislâm.
The Maruts, the youths, placed the maid (lightning on their chariot), their companion for victory (subhé nímislâm).
Sâyana: 'For the sake of water, or, on the brilliant chariot.' Cf. I, 127, 6; 165, I.
VI, 62, 4. súbham príksham ísham û´rgam váhantâ.
The Asvins bringing glory, wealth, drink, and food.
VIII, 26, 13. subhé kakrâte, you bring him to glory.
Subham-yâ´van is an epithet of the Maruts, I, 89, 7; V, 61, 13. Cf. subhra-yâvânâ, VIII, 26, 19 (Asvinau).
Subham-yâ´, of the wind, IV, 3, 6.
Subham-yú, of the rays of the dawn, X, 78, 7.
Verse 4.
Note 1. Sâyana: 'With spotted deer for their horses.' See I, 37, 2, note 1, page 70; as Pûshan is called agâsva, having goats for his horses, RV. V, 58, 2.
That the Maruts have not only prishatîs, but horses for their chariots, we have seen before. In I, 88, 1, we have ásvaparnaih ráthebhih.
Note 2. Ayâ´ is a word of very rare occurrence in the Rig-veda. It is the instrum. sing. of the feminine pronominal base a or î, and as a pronoun followed by a noun it is frequently to be met with; V, 45, 11. ayâ´ dhiyâ´, &c. But in our verse it is irregular in form as not entering into Sandhi with îsânáh. This irregularity, however, which might have led us to suppose an original ayâ´h, indefatigable, corresponding
p. 165
with the following ási, is vouched for by the Pada text, in such matters a better authority than the Samhitâ text, and certainly in this case fully borne out by the Prâtisâkhya, I, 163, 10. Unless we read ayâ´h, we must take ayâ´ as an adverb, in the sense of thus or hence; cf. VI, 66, 4. In some passages where ayâ´ seems thus to be used as an adverb, it would be better to supply a noun from the preceding verse. Thus in II, 6, 2, ayâ´ refers to samídham in II, 6, 1. In VI, 17, 15, a similar noun, samídhâ or girâ´, should be supplied. But there are other passages where, unless we suppose that the verse was meant to illustrate a ceremonial act, such as the placing of a samídh, and that ayâ´ pointed to it, we must take it as a simple adverb, like the Greek τῷ: RV. III, 12, 2; IX, 53, 2; 106, 14. In X, 116, 9, the Pada reads áyâh-iva, not áyâ, as given by Roth; in VI, 66, 4, áyâ nú, the accent is likewise on the first.
Note 3. Rina-yâ´van is well explained by B. and R. as going after debt, searching out sin. Sâyana, though he explains rina-yâ´van by removing sin, derives it nevertheless correctly from rina and yâ, and not from yu. The same formation is found in subham-yâ´van, &c.; and as there is rina-yâ´ besides rina-yâ´van, so we find subham-yâ´ besides subham-yâ´van. Ludwig prefers the derivation from yu.
Verse 5.
Note 1. The Soma-juice inspires the poet with eloquence.
Note 2. Sámi occurs again in II, 31, 6; III, 55, 3; VIII, 45, 27; X, 40, 1. Grassmann has shown that it may be taken as an instrum. of sámî, meaning work, but with special reference to the toil of the battle-field or the sacrifice. It is used in the former sense in
VIII, 45, 27. ví ânat turváne sámi.
He (Indra) was able to overcome, lit. he reached to, or he arrived at the overcoming or at victory by toil.
But, like other words which have the general meaning of working or toiling, sámî is used both in a general sense, and in the more special sense of sacrifice.
X, 40, 1. vástoh-vastoh váhamânam dhiyâ´ sámi.
p. 166
Your chariot, O Asvins, driven along every morning by thought and deed.
II, 31, 6. apâ´m nápât âsu-hémâ dhiyâ´ sámi.
Apâm napât (Agni) moving quickly by thought and deed.
In these two passages it might be possible, with a slight alteration of the accent, to read dhiyâ-sámi as one word. Dhiyâ-sám would mean the sacrificer who is engaged in prayer; cf. dhiyâ-gúr, V, 43, 15. Thus we read:
VI, 2, 4. yáh te su-dâ´nave dhiyâ´ mártah sasámate.
The mortal who toils for thee, the liberal god, with prayer.
There is no necessity, however, for such a change, and the authority of the MSS. is against it. See also IX, 74, 7.
In III, 55, 3, sámi ákkha dîdye pûrvyâ´ni, Roth takes sámi as an acc. plur. neut., Lanman as an instrum., Grassmann as a locative.
I glance back at the former sacrifices. See B. R. s.v. dî and sámi.
In other passages the feminine sámî seems to mean work, sacrificial work, but, as far as we can see, not simply sacrifice. Thus the Ribhus and others are said to have acquired immortality by their work or works, sámî or sámîbhih, I, 20, 2; 110, 4; III, 60, 3; IV, 33, 4. Cf. IV, 22, 8; 17, 18; V, 42, 10; 77, 4; VI, 52, 1; VIII, 75, 14; IX, 74, 7; X, 28, 12. In VI, 3, 2, we read:
îgé yagñébhih sasamé sámîbhih.
I have sacrificed with sacrifices, I have worked with pious works.
Here the verb sam must be taken in the sense of working, or performing ceremonial worship, while in other places (III, 29, 16; V, 2, 7) it may be perhaps taken in the more special sense of singing songs of praise. The Greek κάμ-νω, to work, to labour, to tire (Sanskrit sâmyati), the Greek κομιδή and κομίζω, to labour for or take care of a person, and possibly even the Greek κῶμος a song or a festival (not a village song), may all find their explanation in the Sanskrit root sam.
The idea that the Maruts did not originally enjoy divine
p. 167
honours will occur again and again: cf. I, 6, 4; 72, 3. A similar expression is used of the Ribhus, I, 20, 8, &c. But while originally the expression of obtaining sacred names meant no more than obtaining a sacred or divine character, it was soon taken literally, and a number of names were invented for the Maruts which even in the Vâgasan. Samhitâ XVII, 80-85 amount to 49, i. e. 7 × 7. Yagñíya, properly 'worthy of sacrifice,' has the meaning of divine or sacred. The Greek ἅγιος has been compared with yâgya, sacrificio colendus, which is not a Vedic word.
Verse 6.
Note 1. Sriyáse kám seems to be the same as the more frequent sriyé kám. Sriyáse only occurs twice more, V, 59, 3. The chief irregularity consists in the absence of Guna, which is provided for by Pânini's kasen (III, 4, 9). Similar infinitives, if they may so be called, are bhiyáse, V, 29, 4; vridháse, V, 64, 5; dhruváse, VII, 70, 1; tugáse, IV, 23, 7; riñgáse, VIII, 4, 17; vriñgáse, VIII, 76, 1; rikáse, VII, 61, 6. In VI, 39, 5, rikáse may be a dat. sing. of the masculine, to the praiser.
Note 2. Mimikshire from myaksh, to be united with. Rasmí, rays, after bhânú, splendour, may seem weak. It might be possible to assign to rasmí the meaning of reins, and take rikvabhir in the sense of sounding or tinkling. In V, 79, 8, arkí is used in juxtaposition with rasmí.
Note 3. The bearing of this concluding verse is not quite clear, unless we take it as a continuation of the preceding verse. It was there said that the Maruts (the ríkvânah) obtained their holy names after having joined Indra in his work, which means that they then and there became what they are. Having thus obtained their true character and a place among the gods, they may be said to have won at the same time splendour, and worshippers to sing their praises, and to have established themselves in what became afterwards known as their own domain, their own place among the gods who are invoked at the sacrifice. See VII, 58, 1.
The metre requires that we should read dhâmanah.
p. 168
Benfey translates: Gedeih’n zu spenden woll’n die schöngeschmücketen mit Lichtern, Strahlen mit Lobsängern regenen; die brüllenden, furchtlosen, stürmischen, sie sind bekannt als Glieder des geliebten Marutstamms.
Wilson: Combining with the solar rays, they have willingly poured down (rain) for the welfare (of mankind), and, hymned by the priests, have been pleased partakers of the (sacrificial food). Addressed with praises, moving swiftly, and exempt from fear, they have become possessed of a station agreeable and suitable to the Maruts.
Ludwig: Zu herlichkeit haben dise sich mit liechtglanz versehen, mit sausenden zügeln die schönberingten, schwertbewaffnet die kraftvollen, ohne furcht besitzen sie die freundliche Marutmacht.

"
14,"MANDALA I, HYMN 88.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 6, VARGA 14.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. Come hither, Maruts, on your chariots charged with lightning, resounding with beautiful songs 1, stored with spears, and winged with horses! Fly 3 to us like birds, with your best food 2, you mighty ones!
2. They come gloriously on their red, or, it may be, on their tawny horses which hasten their chariots. He who holds the axe 1 is brilliant like gold;—with the tire 2 of the chariot they have struck the earth.
3. On your bodies there are daggers for beauty; may they stir up our minds 1 as they stir up the forests. For yourselves, O well-born Maruts, the vigorous (among you) shake 2 the stone (for distilling Soma).
4. Days went round you and came back 1, O hawks, back to this prayer, and to this sacred rite; the Gotamas making prayer with songs, pushed up the lid of the well (the cloud) for to drink.
5. No such hymn 1 was ever known as this which Gotama sounded for you, O Maruts, when he saw you on golden wheels, wild boars 2 rushing about with iron tusks.
6. This comforting speech rushes sounding towards you, like the speech of a suppliant: it rushed freely from our hands as our speeches are wont to do.
p. 170
NOTES.
This hymn is ascribed to Gotama, the son of Rahûgana. The metre varies. Verses 1 and 6 are put down as Prastâra-paṅkti, i. e. as 12 + 12 + 8 + 8. By merely counting the syllables, and dissolving semivowels, it is just possible to get twenty-four syllables in the first line of verses 1 and 6. The old metricians must have scanned verse 1:


[paragraph continues]
Again verse 6:


[paragraph continues]
But the general character of these lines shows that they were intended for hendecasyllabics, each ending in a bacchius, though even then they are not free from irregularities. The first verse would scan:


[paragraph continues]
And verse 6:


[paragraph continues]
Our only difficulty would be the termination bhih of rishtimat-bhih. I cannot adopt Professor Kuhn's suggestion to drop the Visarga of bhih and change i into y (Beiträge, vol. iv, p. 198), for this would be a license without any parallel. It is different with sah, originally sa, or with feminines in ih, where parallel forms in î are intelligible. The simplest correction would be to read răthēbhīh yâ̄ta ̄͡rishtĭ-māntah ̄͡asvă-pārnaih. One might urge in support of this reading that in all other passages where rishtimat occurs, it refers to the Maruts themselves, and never to their chariots. Yet the difficulty remains, how could so simple a reading have been replaced by a more difficult one?
p. 171
In the two Gâyatrî pâdas which follow I feel equally reluctant to alter. I therefore scan


taking the dactyl of paptata as representing a spondee, and admitting the exceptionàl bacchius instead of the amphimacer at the end of the line.
The last line of verse 6 should be scanned:


There are two other verses in this hymn where the metre is difficult. In the last pâda of verse 5 we have seven syllables instead of eleven. Again, I say, it would be most easy to insert one of the many tetrasyllabic epithets of the Maruts. But this would have been equally easy for the collectors of the Veda. Now the authors of the Anukramanîs distinctly state that this fifth verse is virâdrûpâ, i. e. that one of its pâdas consists of eight syllables. How they would have made eight syllables out of vi-dhâvatah varâhûn does not appear, but at all events they knew that last pâda to be imperfect. The rhythm does not suffer by this omission, as long as we scan vĭ-dhâ̄vătāh vărâ̄hû̄n.
Lastly, there is the third pâda of the second verse, rukmah na kitrah svadhiti-vân. It would not be possible to get eleven syllables out of this, unless we admitted vyûha not only in sv̆ădhĭtĭvâ̄n or sv̆ădhĭtî̄-vâ̄n, but also in kĭtrăh̄. Kuhn (Beiträge, vol. iv, p. 192) proposes to scan rukmaü na kitarah svadhitivân. Nothing would be easier than to insert eshâm after kitrah, but the question occurs again, how could eshâm be lost, or why, if by some accident it had been lost, was not so obvious a correction made by Saunaka and Kâtyâyana?
No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB.
Verse 1.
Note 1. Alluding to the music of the Maruts, and not to the splendour of the lightning which is mentioned before. See Wolf, Beiträge zur Deutschen Mythologie, vol. ii, p. 137. 'Das Ross and den Wagen des Gottes begleitet munterer Hörnerschall, entweder stösst er selbst ins Horn,
p. 172
oder sein Gefolge. Oft vernimmt man auch eine liebliche Musik, der keine auf Erden gleich kommt (Müllenhof, 582). Das wird das Pfeifen and Heulen des Sturmes sein, nur in idealisirter Art.' Ibid. p. 158.
Note 2. Várshishtha, which is generally explained as the superlative of vriddha, old (Pân. VI, 4, 157), has in most passages of the Rig-veda the more general meaning of strong or excellent: VI, 47, 9. ísham â´ vakshi ishâ´m várshishthâm; III, 13, 7 (vásu); III, 26, 8 (rátna); III, 16, 3 (raí); IV, 31, 15; VIII, 46, 24 (srávah); IV, 22, 9 (nrimná); V, 67, 1 (kshatrá); VI, 45, 31 (mûrdhán). In some passages, however, it may be taken in the sense of oldest (I, 37, 6; V, 7, 1), though by no means necessarily. Várshishtha is derived in reality from vríshan, in the sense of strong, excellent. See note to I, 85, 12, page 144.
Note 3. Paptata, the second person plural of the imperative of what is commonly, though without much reason, called the aorist of the causative of pat. It is curiously like the Greek πίπτετε, but it has the meaning of flying rather than falling; see Curtius, Grundzüge, p. 190. Two other forms formed on the same principle occur in the Rig-veda, paptah and paptan:
II, 31, 1. prá yát váyah ná páptan.
That they may fly to us like birds.
VI, 63, 6. prá vâm váyah—ánu paptan.
May your birds fly after you.
X, 95, 15. púrûravah mâ´ mrithâh mâ´ prá paptah.
Purûravas, do not die, do not go away!
Verse 2.
Note 1. Though svadhiti-vân does not occur again, it can only mean he who holds the axe, or, it may be, the sword or the thunderbolt, the latter particularly, if Indra is here intended. Svadhiti signifies axe:
III, 2, 10. svá-dhitim ná tégase.
They adorned Agni like an axe to shine or to cut.
The svádhiti is used by the butcher, I, 162, 9; 18; 20; and by the wood-cutter or carpenter, III, 8, 6; 11; X, 89, 7, &c. Roth (s. v.) takes svadhiti as meaning also a tree,
p. 173
possibly the oak, and he translates svadhitivân in our passage by a chariot made of the wood of the Svadhiti tree. In RV. IX, 96, 6, svádhitir vánânâm may well mean 'the strong axe among woods,' the axe being naturally made of the strongest wood. In V, 32, 10, a devî´ svádhitih is mentioned, possibly the lightning, the companion of Indra and the Maruts.
Note 2. The tire of the chariot of the Maruts is frequently mentioned. It was considered not only as an essential part of their chariot, but likewise as useful for crushing the enemy:
V, 52, 9. utá pavyâ´ ráthânâm ádrim bhindanti ógasâ.
They cut the mountain (cloud) with the tire of their chariots.
I, 166, 10. pavíshu kshurâ´h ádhi.
On their tires are sharp edges.
In V, 31, 5, tires are mentioned without horses and chariot, which were turned by Indra against the Dasyus (I, 64, 11). I doubt, however, whether in India or elsewhere the tires or the wheels of chariots were ever used as weapons of attack, as detached from the chariot; (see M. M., On Pavîrava, in Beiträge zur Vergleichenden Sprachforschung, vol. iii, p. 447.) If we translate the figurative language of the Vedic poets into matter-of-fact terms, the tires of the chariots of the Maruts may be rendered by thunderbolts; yet by the poets of the Veda, as by the ancient people of Germany, thunder was really supposed to be the noise of the chariot of a god, and it was but a continuation of the same belief that the sharp wheels of that chariot were supposed to cut and crush the clouds; (see M. M., loc. cit., p. 444.)
Verse 3.
Note 1. That the vâ´sîs are small weapons, knives or daggers, we saw before, p. 71. Sâyana here explains vâ´sî by a weapon commonly called âra, or an awl. In X, 101, 10, vâ´sîs are mentioned, made of stone, asman-máyî.
The difficulty begins with the second half. Medhâ´, as here written in the Pada text, could only be a plural of
p. 174
a neuter medhá, but such a neuter does nowhere exist in the Veda. We only find the masculine médha, sacrifice, which is out of the question here, on account of its accent. Hence the passage III, 58, 2, ûrdhvâ´h bhavanti pitárâ-iva médhâh, is of no assistance, unless we alter the accent. The feminine medhâ´ means will, thought, prayer: I, 18, 6; II, 34, 7; IV, 33, 10; V, 27, 4; 42, 13; VII, 104, 6; VIII, 6, 10; 52, 9; IX, 9, 9; 26, 3; 32, 6; 65, 16; 107, 25; X, 91, 8. The construction does not allow us to take medhâ´ as a Vedic instrumental instead of medháyâ, nor does such a form occur anywhere else in the Rig-veda. Nothing remains, I believe, but to have recourse to conjecture, and the addition of a single Visarga in the Pada would remove all difficulty. In the next line, if tuvi-dyumnâ´sah be the subject, it would signify the priests. This, however, is again without any warrant from the Rig-veda, where tuvi-dyumná is always used as an epithet of gods. I therefore take it as referring to the Maruts, as an adjective in the nominative, following the vocatives marutah su-gâtâh. The conception that the Maruts stir up the forests is not of unfrequent occurrence in the Rig-veda cf. I, 171, 3. That ûrdhvá is used of the mind, in the sense of roused, may be seen in I, 119, 2; 134, I; 144, 1; VII, 64, 4. The idea in the poet's mind seems to have been that the thunderbolts of the Maruts rouse up men to prayer as they stir the tops of the forest trees. Ludwig takes medha, masc., in the sense of lance, comparing it with Icelandic meidhr, but the two words cannot well be the same. Possibly vana may be meant for lances: 'May they raise our minds, like lances;' see note to I, 171, 3.
Note 2. On dhan in the sense of to agitate, see B. and R. s. v. The shaking of the stone may be the shaking of the stone for distilling the heavenly Soma or the rain; but adri may also be meant for the thunderbolt. I now take tuvidyumna for an adjective referring to the Maruts, because it is a divine rather than a human epithet. Still, the passage is doubtful.
Verse 4.
Note 1. The first question is, which is the subject, áhâni
p. 175
or grídhrâh? If grídhrâh were the subject, then we should have to translate it by the eager poets, and take áhâni in the sense of visvâ ahâni. The sense then might be: 'Day by day did the eager poets sing around you this prayer.' There would be several objections, however, to this rendering. First, grídhrâh, though metaphorically applicable to poets, never occurs again as signifying poets or priests. One passage only could be quoted in support, IX, 97, 57, kaváyah ná grídhrâh (not gridhrâ´h), like greedy poets. But even here, if indeed the translation is right, the adjective is explained by kaví, and does not stand by itself. Secondly, áhâni by itself is never used adverbially in the sense of day after day. The only similar passage that might be quoted is III, 34, 10, and that is very doubtful. To take áhâni as a totally different word, viz. as á + hâni, without ceasing, without wearying, would be too bold in the present state of Vedic interpretation. If then we take áhâni as the subject, grídhrâh would have to be taken as a vocative, and intended for the Maruts. Now, it is perfectly true, that by itself grídhra, hawk, does not occur again as a name of the Maruts, but syená, hawk, and particularly a strong hawk (IX, 96, 6), is not only a common simile applied to the Maruts, but is actually used as one of their names:
VII, 56, 3. abhí sva-pû´bhih mitháh vapanta vâ´ta-svanasah syenâ´h aspridhran.
They plucked each other with their beaks (?), the hawks, rushing like the wind, strove together.
Aguh might be the aorist of gai, to sing, or of gâ, to go:
I, 174, 8. sánâ tâ´ te indra návyâh â´ aguh.
New poets, O Indra, sang these thy old deeds.
III, 56, 2. gâ´vah â´ aguh.
The cows approached.
If then the sense of the first line is, 'Days went and came back to you,' the next question is whether we are to extend the construction to the next words, imâ´m dhíyam vârkâryâ´m ka devî´m, or whether these words are to be joined to krinvántah, like bráhma. The meaning of
p. 176
vârkâryâ´ is, of course, unknown. Sâyana's interpretation as 'what is to be made by means of water' is merely etymological, and does not help us much. It is true that the object of the hymn, which is addressed to the Maruts, is rain, and that literally vârkâryâ´ might be explained as 'that the effect of which is rain.' But this is far too artificial a word for Vedic poets. Possibly there was some other word that had become unintelligible and which, by a slight change, was turned into vârkâryâ´, in order to give the meaning of rain-producing. It might have been karkârya, glorious, or the song of a poet called Vârkara, or, as Ludwig suggests, Vrikâri. The most likely supposition is that vârkâryâ´ was the name given to some famous hymn, some pæan or song of triumph belonging to the Gotamas, possibly to some verses of the very hymn before us. In this case the epithet devî´ would be quite appropriate, for it is frequently used for a sacred or sacrificial song: IV, 43, 2: devî´m su-stutím; III, i 8, 3. imâ´m dhíyam sata-séyâya devî´m. See, however, the note to verse 6.
The purport of the whole line would then be that many days have gone for the Maruts as well as for the famous hymn once addressed to them by Gotama, or, in other words, that the Gotamas have long been devoted to the Maruts, an idea frequently recurring in the hymns of the Veda, and, in our case, carried on in the next verse, where it is said that the present hymn is like one that Gotama composed when he saw the Maruts or spoke of them as wild boars with iron tusks. The pushing up the lid of the well for to drink, means that they obtained rain from the cloud, which is here, as before, represented as a covered well.
See another explanation in Haug, Über die ursprüngliche Bedeutung des Wortes Brahma, 1868, p. 5.
Verse 5.
Note 1. Yógana commonly means a chariot:
VI, 62, 6. arenû-bhih yóganebhih bhugántâ.
You who possess dustless chariots.
VIII, 72, 6. ásva-vat yóganam brihát.
p. 177
The great chariot with horses.
It then became the name for a distance to be accomplished without unharnessing the horses, just as the Latin jugum, a yoke, then a juger of land, 'quod uno jugo boum uno die exarari posset,' Pliny XVIII, 3, 3, 9.
In our passage, however, yógana means a hymn, lit. a composition, which is clearly its meaning in
VIII, 90, 3. bráhma te indra girvanah kriyánte ánatidbhutâ, imâ´ gushasva hari-asva yóganâ índra yâ´ te ámanmahi.
Unequalled prayers are made for thee, praiseworthy Indra; accept these hymns which we have devised for thee, O Indra with bright horses!
Note 2. Varâ´hu has here the same meaning as varâhá, wild boar (VIII, 77, 10; X, 28, 4). It occurs once more, I, 121, 11, as applied to Vritra, who is also called varâhá, I, 61, 7; X, 99, 6. In X, 67, 7, vrísha-bhih varâ´haih (with the accent on the penultimate) is intended for the Maruts a. Except in this passage, varâha has the accent on the last syllable. In IX, 97, 7, varâhá is applied to Soma.
Verse 6.
This last verse is almost unintelligible to me. I give, however, the various attempts that have been made to explain it.
Wilson: This is that praise, Maruts, which, suited (to your merits), glorifies every one of you. The speech of the priest has now glorified you, without difficulty, with sacred verses, since (you have placed) food in our hands.
Benfey: Dies Lied—Maruts!—das hinter euch emporstrebt, es klingt zurück gleich eines Beters Stimme. Mühlos schuf solche Lieder er, entsprechend eurer Arme Kraft. (Note: Der zum Himmel schallende Lobgesang findet seinen Widerhall (wirklich, 'bebt zurück') in dem Sturmgeheul

p. 178
der Maruts, welches mit dem Geheul des Betenden verglichen wird.)
Ludwig: Dises lied, o Marut, euch unterstützend (aufnemend) als eines priesters braust euch entgegen, nachbrausen hat es gemacht ohne mühe in (die) der nähe die göttliche weise (ihrer) arme.
My own translation is to a great extent conjectural. It seems to me from verse 3, that the poet offers both a hymn of praise and a libation of Soma. Possibly vârkâryâ in verse 4 might be taken in the sense of Soma-juice, and be derived from valkala, which in later Sanskrit means the bark of trees. In that case verse 5 would again refer to the hymn of Gotama, and verse 6 to the libation which is to accompany it. Anu-bhartrî´ does not occur again, but it can only mean what supports or refreshes, and therefore would be applicable to a libation of Soma which supports the gods. The verb stobhati would well express the rushing sound of the Soma, as in I, 168, 8, it expresses the rushing noise of the waters against the fellies of the chariots. The next line adds little beyond stating that this libation of Soma rushes forth freely from the hands, the gabhastis being specially mentioned in other passages where the crushing of the Soma-plant is described:
IX, 71, 3. ádri-bhih sutáh pavate gábhastyoh.
The Soma squeezed by the stones runs from the hands.
The translation would then be: O Maruts, this comforting draught (of Soma) rushes towards you, like the speech of a suppliant; it rushed freely from our hands, as our draughts (of Soma) are wont to do.

"
15,"MANDALA I, HYMN 165.","ASHTAKA II, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 24-26.",To the Maruts and Indra,"The Prologue.
The sacrificer speaks:
1. To what splendour do the Maruts all equally 1 cling 2, they who are of the same age, and dwell in the same nest? With what thoughts?—from whence are they come 3? Do these heroes sing forth their (own) strength 4, wishing for wealth?
2. Whose prayers have the youths accepted? Who has turned the Maruts to his own sacrifice? By what strong desire 1 may we arrest them, they who float through the air like hawks?
The Dialogue.
The Maruts speak:
3. From whence 1, O Indra, dost thou come alone, thou who art mighty? O lord of men 2, what has thus happened to thee? Thou greetest (us) 3 when thou comest together with (us), the bright (Maruts) 4. Tell us then, thou with thy bay horses, what thou hast against us!
Indra speaks:
4. The sacred songs are mine, (mine are) the prayers 1; sweet 2 are the libations! My strength rises 3, my thunderbolt is hurled forth. They call for me, the hymns yearn for me. Here are my horses, they carry me hither.
The Maruts speak:
5. From thence, in company with our strong
p. 180
friends 1, having adorned our bodies, we now harness our fallow deer 2 with all our might 3;—for, Indra, according to custom, thou hast come to be with us.
Indra speaks:
6. Where, O Maruts, was that custom with you, when you left me alone in the killing of Ahi? I indeed am terrible, powerful, strong,—I escaped from the blows of every enemy 1.
The Maruts speak:
7. Thou hast achieved much with us as companions 1. With equal valour, O hero! let us achieve then many things, O thou most powerful, O Indra! whatever we, O Maruts, wish with our mind 2.
Indra speaks:
8. I slew Vritra, O Maruts, with (Indra's) might, having grown powerful through my own vigour; I, who hold the thunderbolt in my arms, have made these all-brilliant waters to flow freely for man 1.
The Maruts speak:
9. Nothing, O mighty lord, is strong 1 before thee: no one is known among the gods 2 like unto thee. No one who is now born 3 comes near, no one who has been born. Do what thou wilt do 4, thou who art grown so strong.
Indra speaks:
10. Almighty strength be mine alone, whatever I may do, daring in my heart 1; for I indeed, O Maruts, am known as terrible: of all that I threw down, I, Indra, am the lord.
Indra speaks:
11. O Maruts, now your praise has pleased me, the glorious hymn which you have made for me, ye
p. 181
men!—for me, for Indra, for the joyful hero, as friends for a friend, for your own sake, and by your own efforts 1.
Indra speaks:
12. Truly, there they are, shining towards me, bringing blameless glory, bringing food. O Maruts, wherever I have looked for you, you have appeared to me in bright splendour: appear to me also now!
The Epilogue.
The sacrificer speaks:
13. Who has magnified you here, O Maruts? Come hither, O friends, towards your friends. Ye brilliant Maruts, welcoming 1 these prayers, be mindful 2 of these my rites.
14. The wisdom of Mânya has brought us hither, that he should help as the poet helps the performer of a sacrifice 1: turn hither quickly 2! Maruts, on to the sage! the singer has recited these prayers for you.
15. May this your praise, O Maruts, this song of Mândârya, the son of Mâna 1, the poet, bring offspring 2 for ourselves with food. May we have an invigorating autumn, with quickening rain 3.
p. 182
NOTES.
A critical examination of Professor von Roth's remarks on this hymn, together with some supplementary notes of my own, will be found in the Preface to this volume.
According to the Anukramanikâ this hymn is a dialogue between Agastya, the Maruts, and Indra. A careful consideration of the hymn would probably have led us to a similar conclusion, but I doubt whether it would have led us to adopt the same distribution of the verses among the poet, the Maruts, and Indra, as that adopted by the author of the Anukramanikâ. He assigns the first two verses to Indra, the third, fifth, seventh, and ninth to the Maruts, the fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth to Indra, and the three concluding verses to Agastya. I think that the two verses in the beginning, as well as the three concluding verses, belong certainly to Agastya or to whoever else the real performer of the sacrifice may have been. The two verses in the beginning cannot be ascribed to Indra, who, to judge from his language, would never say: 'By what strong desire may we arrest the Maruts?' It might seem, in fact, as if the three following verses too should be ascribed to the sacrificer, so that the dialogue between Indra and the Maruts would begin only with the sixth verse. The third verse might well be addressed to Indra by the sacrificer, and in the fourth verse we might see a description of all that he had done for Indra. What is against this view, however, is the phrase prábhritah me ádrih. If used by the sacrificer, it might seem to mean, 'my stone, i. e. the stone used for squeezing the Soma, has been brought forth.' But though Professor Roth assigns this meaning to prábhrita in our passage, I doubt whether, in connection with ádri, or with vágra, prábhrita can mean anything but hurled. Thus we read:
I, 61, 12. asmaí ít ûm (íti) prá bhara—vritrâ´ya vágram.
Hurl thou, Indra, the thunderbolt against this Vritra.
V, 32, 7. yát îm vágrasya prá-bhritau dadâ´bha.
When Indra conquered him in the hurling of the thunderbolt.
p. 183
I therefore suppose the dialogue to begin with verse 3, and I find that Langlois, though it may be from different reasons, arrived at the same conclusion.
There can be little doubt that the other verses, to verse 12, are rightly apportioned between Indra and the Maruts. Verse 12 might perhaps be attributed again to the worshipper of the Maruts, but as there is no absolute necessity for assigning it to him, it is better to follow the tradition and to take it as the last verse of Indra's speech. It would seem, in fact, as if these ten verses, from 3 to 12, formed an independent poem, which was intended to show the divine power of the Maruts. That their divine power was sometimes denied, and that Indra's occasional contempt of them was well known to the Vedic poets, will become evident from other hymns. This dialogue seems therefore to have been distinctly intended to show that, in spite of occasional misunderstandings between the Maruts and the all-powerful Indra, Indra himself had fully recognised their power and accepted their friendship. If we suppose that this dialogue was repeated at sacrifices in honour of the Maruts, or that possibly it was acted by two parties, one representing Indra, the other the Maruts and their followers, then the two verses in the beginning and the three at the end ought to be placed in the mouth of the actual sacrificer, whoever he was. He begins by asking, Who has attracted the Maruts to his sacrifice, and by what act of praise and worship can they be delighted? Then follows the dialogue in honour of the Maruts, and after it the sacrificer asks again, 'Who has magnified the Maruts, i. e. have not we magnified them?' and he implores them to grant him their friendship in recognition of his acts of worship. If then we suppose that the dialogue was the work of Mândârya Mânya, the fourteenth verse, too, would lose something of its obscurity. Coming from the mouth of the actual sacrificer, it would mean, 'the wisdom, or the poetical power, of Mânya has brought us to this, has induced us to do this, i. e. to perform this dialogue of Mânya, so that he, Mânya, should assist, as a poet assists the priest at a sacrifice.' Of course all this is and can only be guess-work.
p. 184
[paragraph continues]
We do not know the age of Mânya nor that of Agastya. We do not know whether they were Contemporaries or not. But supposing that Mânya was present at the sacrifice, vípra might be meant for Mânya; and in the last words, too, 'the singer has recited these prayers for you,' the singer (garitâ´) might again be Mânya, the powerful poet whose services the sacrificer had engaged, and whose famous dialogue between Indra and the Maruts was considered a safe means of winning their favour. It would be in keeping with all this, if in the last verse the sacrificer once more informed the Maruts that this hymn of praise was the work of the famous poet Mândârya, the son of Mâna, and if he then concluded with the usual prayer for safety, food, and progeny.
No verse of this hymn occurs in the Sâma-veda; verse 3 = VS. XXXIII, 27; verse 4 = VS. XXXIII, 78; verse 6 = TB. II, 8, 3, 5; verse 8 = TB. 11, 8, 3, 6; verse 9 = VS. XXXIII, 79.
Verse 1.
Note 1. As samânî´ occurs in the Veda as the feminine of samâna (cf. IV, 51, 9; X, 191, 3; 4), samânyâ´ might, no doubt, be taken as an instrumental, belonging to subhâ´. We should then have to translate: 'With what equal splendour are the Maruts endowed?' Sâyana adopts the same explanation, while Wilson, who seems to have read samânyâh, translates 'of one dignity.' Professor Roth, s. v. myaksh, would seem to take samânyâ´ as some kind of substantive, and he refers to another passage, I, 167, 4, sâdhâranyâ´-iva marútah mimikshuh, without, however, detailing his interpretation of these passages.
It cannot be said that Sâyana's explanation is objectionable, yet there is something awkward in qualifying by an adjective, however indefinite, what forms the subject of an interrogative sentence, and it would be possible to avoid this, by taking samânyâ´ as an adverb. It is clearly used as an adverb in III, 54, 7; VIII, 83, 8.
Note 2. Mimikshuh is the perfect of myaksh, in the sense of to be firmly joined with something. It has therefore a more definite meaning than the Latin miscere and the Greek μίσγειν, which come from the same source, i. e.
p. 185
from a root mik or mig, in Sanskrit also mis in mis-ra; (see Curtius, Grundzüge, p. 300.) There may be indeed one or two passages in the Veda where myaksh seems to have the simple meaning of mixing, but it will be seen that they constitute a small minority compared with those where myaksh has the meaning of holding to, sticking to; I mean
X, 104, 2. mimikshúh yám ádrayah indra túbhyam.
The Soma which the stones have mixed for thee.
This form cannot be derived from mimiksh, but is the 3rd pers. plur. perf. Parasm. of myaksh. It may, however, be translated, 'This Soma which the stones have grasped or squeezed for thee,' as may be seen from passages quoted hereafter, in which myaksh is construed with an accusative.
II, 3, 11. ghritám mimikshe.
The butter has been mixed.
This form cannot be derived from mimiksh, but is the 3rd pers. sing. perf. Âtm. of myaksh. If the meaning of mixing should be considered inadmissible, we might in this verse also translate, 'The butter has become fixed, solid, or coagulated.'
Leaving out of consideration for the present the forms which are derived from mimiksh, we find the following passages in which myaksh occurs. Its original meaning must have been to be mixed with, to be joined to, and in many passages that original sense is still to be recognised, only with the additional idea of being firmly joined, of sticking to, or, in an active sense, laying hold of, grasping firmly.
1. Without any case:
I, 169, 3. ámyak sâ´ te indra rishtíh asmé (íti).
This thy spear, O Indra, sat firm for us.
This would mean that Indra held his weapon well, as a soldier ought to hold his spear. Ámyak is the 3rd pers. sing. of a second aor. Parasm., ámyaksham, ámyak(sh + t); (Say. prâpnoti.) Cf. VIII, 61, 18.
2. With locative:
X, 44, 2. mimyáksha vágrah nri-pate gabhástau.
In thy fist, O king, the thunderbolt rests firmly.
p. 186
I, 167, 3. mimyáksha yéshu sû-dhitâ—rishtíh.
To whom clings the well-grasped spear.
VI, 50, 5. mimyáksha yéshu rodasî´ nú devî´.
To whom the goddess Rodasî clings. (Sây. samgakkhate.)
VI, 11, 5. ámyakshi sádma sádane prithivyâ´h.
The seat was firmly set on the seat of the earth. (Sây. gamyate, parigrihyate.) It is the 3rd pers. sing. aor. pass.
VI, 29, 2. â´ yásmin háste náryâh mimikshúh â´ ráthe hiranyáye rathe-sthâ´h, â´ rasmáyah gábhastyoh sthûráyoh â´ ádhvan ásvâsah vríshanah yugânâ´h.
To whose hand men cling, in whose golden chariot the drivers stand firm, in whose strong fists the reins are well held, on whose path the harnessed stallions hold together. (Say. âsikyante, âpûryante; or âsiñkanti, pûrayanti.)
X, 96, 3. índre ní rûpâ´ háritâ mimikshire.
Bright colours stuck or clung or settled on Indra. (Sây. nishiktâni babhûvuh; miheh sanantât karmani rûpam.)
3. With instrumental:
I, 165, 1. káyâ subhâ´ marûtah sám mimikshuh.
To what splendour do the Maruts cling; or, what splendour clings to them?
V, 58, 5. sváyâ matyâ´ marûtah sám mimikshuh. (See also I, 165, 1.)
The Maruts cling to their own thought or will. (Sây. vrishtyâ samyak siñkanti.)
I, 167, 4. yavyâ´ sâdhâranyâ´-iva marútah mimikshuh.
The Maruts cling to the young maid, as if she belonged to all. See I, 173, 12; VIII, 98, 8; or VI, 27, 6,
I, 87, 6. bhânú-bhih sám mimikshire.
The Maruts were joined with splendour. (Sây. medhum ikkhanti.)
4. With accusative:
VIII, 61, 18. ni yâ´ vágram mimikshátuh.
Thy two arms which have firmly grasped the thunderbolt. (Say. parigrihnîtah.)
Here I should also prefer to place VII, 20, 4, if we might read mimikshe or mimyáksha, for it is impossible to take mímikshan for anything but a participle of the desiderative of mih, which does not yield an appropriate meaning.
p. 187
ní vágram índrah mímikshan.
Grasping firmly the thunderbolt. (Sây. satrushu prâpayan.)
VI, 29, 3. sriyé te pâ´dâ dûvah â´ mimikshuh.
Thy servants embrace thy feet for their happiness. (Sây. âsiñkanti, samarpayanti.)
Like other verbs which mean to join, myaksh, if accompanied by prepositions expressive of separation, means to separate. (Cf. vi-yukta, se-junctus.)
II, 28, 6. ápo (íti) sú myaksha varuna bhiyásam mát.
Remove well from me, O Varuna, terror. (Sây. apagamaya.)
Quite distinct from this is the desiderative or inchoative verb mimiksh, from mih, in the sense of to sprinkle, or to shower, chiefly used with reference to the gods who are asked to sprinkle the sacrifice with rain. Thus we read:
I, 142, 3. mádhvâ yagñám mimikshati.
(Narâsamsa) sprinkles the sacrifice with rain.
IX, 107, 6. mádhvâ yagñám mimiksha nah.
Sprinkle (O Soma) our sacrifice with rain.
I, 34, 3. tríh adyá yagñám mádhunâ mimikshatam.
O Asvins, sprinkle the sacrifice with rain thrice to-day!
I, 47, 4. mádhvâ yagñám mimikshatam.
O Asvins, sprinkle the sacrifice with rain!
5. Without mádhu:
I, 22, 13. mahî´ dyaûh prithivî´ ka nah imám yagñám mimikshatâm.
May the great heaven and earth sprinkle this our sacrifice.
6. With mádhu in the accusative:
VI, 70, 5. mádhu nah dyâ´vâprithivî´ (íti) mimikshatâm.
May heaven and earth shower down rain for us.
Very frequently the Asvins are asked to sprinkle the sacrifice with their whip. This whip seems originally, like the whip of the Maruts, to have been intended for the cracking noise of the storm, preceding the rain. Then as whips had possibly some similarity to the instruments used for sprinkling butter on the sacrificial viands, the Asvins are
p. 188
asked to sprinkle the sacrifice with their whip, i. e. to give rain:
I, 157, 4. mádhu-matyâ nah kasayâ mimikshatam.
O Asvins, sprinkle us with your rain-giving whip.
I, 22, 3. táyâ yagñám mimikshatam.
O Asvins, sprinkle the sacrifice with it (your whip).
7. Lastly, we find such phrases as,
I, 48, 16. sám nah râyâ´—mimikshvá.
Sprinkle us with wealth, i. e. shower wealth down upon us. Here mih is really treated as a Hu-verb in the Âtmanepada, though others take it for mimikshasva.
As an adjective, mimikshú is applied to Indra (III, 50, 3), and mimikshá to Soma (VI, 34, 4).
Note 3. I do not see how étâsah can here be taken in any sense but that suggested by the Pada, â´-itâsah, come near. Professor Roth thinks it not impossible that it may be meant for étâh, the fallow deer, the usual team of the Maruts. These Etas are mentioned in verse 5, but there the Pada gives quite correctly étân, not â´-itân, and Sâyana explains it accordingly by gantûn.
Note 4. The idea that the Maruts proclaim their own strength occurred before, I, 87, 3. It is a perfectly natural conception, for the louder the voice of the wind, the greater its strength, and vice versa.
Verse 2.
Note 1. Mánas here, as elsewhere, is used in the sense of thought preceding speech, desire, or devotion not yet expressed in prayer. See Taitt. Samh. V, 1, 3, 3. yat purusho manasâbhigakkhati tad vâkâ vadati, what a man grasps in his mind, that he expresses by speech. Professor Roth suggests an emendation which is ingenious, but not necessary, viz. mahâ´ námasâ, with great adoration, an expression which occurs, if not in VI, 52, 17, at least in VII, 12, 1. We find, however, the phrase mahâ´ mánasâ in
VI, 40, 4.


p. 189
Come hither, thou hast always come, Indra, to our libation through our yearning great desire. Mayest thou hear these our prayers, and may then the sacrifice put vigour in thy body.
It is curious to observe that throughout the Rig-veda the instrumental singular mahâ´ is always used as an adjective belonging to some term or other for praise and prayer. Besides the passages mentioned, we find:
II, 24, 1. ayâ´ vidhema návayâ mahâ´ girâ´.
Let us sacrifice with this new great song.
VI, 52, 17. su-ukténa mahâ´ námasâ â´ vivâse.
I worship with a hymn with great adoration, or I worship with a great hymn in adoration. VIII, 46, 14. gâya girâ´ mahâ´ ví-ketasam. Celebrate the wise Indra with a great song. Otherwise we might translate, Thou hast always come with a great yearning desire.
Verse 3.
Note 1. We ought to scan kŭtāh t̆văm īnd̆ră mâ̄hĭnāh san, because yâsi, being anudâtta, could not begin a new pâda. It would be more natural to translate kútah by why? for the Maruts evidently wish to express their surprise at Indra's going to do battle alone and without their assistance. I do not think, however, that in the Rig-veda, even in the latest hymns, kútah has as yet a causal meaning, and I have therefore translated it in the same sense in which it occurs before in the poet's address to the Maruts.
Note 2. Sat-pati, lord of men, means lord of real men, of heroes, and should not be translated by good lord. Sat by itself is frequently used in the sense of heroes, of men physically rather than morally good:
II, I, 3. tvám agne índrah vrishabháh satâ´m asi.
Thou, Agni, art Indra, the hero among heroes.
I, 173, 7. samát-su tvâ sûra satâ´m urânám.
Thee, O hero, in battles the protector of (good and true) men.
Note 3. The meaning of sám prikkhase is very much the same as that of sám vadasva in I, 170, 5.
Note 4. Subhâná is evidently meant as a name for the
p. 190
[paragraph continues]
Maruts, who thus speak of themselves in the third person, which is by no means unusual in the Rig-veda.
Mahîdhara explains subhânaih by sobhanair vakanaih.
Verse 4.
Indra certainly addresses his old friends, the Maruts, very unceremoniously, but this, though at first startling, was evidently the intention of the poet. He wished to represent a squabble between Indra and the Maruts, such as they were familiar with in their own village life, and this was to be followed by a reconciliation. The boorish rudeness, selfishness, and boastfulness here ascribed to Indra may seem offensive to those who cannot divest themselves of the modern meaning of deities, but looked upon from the right point of view, it is really full of interest.
Note 1. Bráhmâni and matáyah are here mentioned separately in the same way as a distinction is made between bráhman, stóma, and ukthá, IV, 22, I; VI, 23, 1; between bráhmâni and gírah, III, 51, 6; between bráhma, gírah, and stómah, VI, 38, 3; between bráhma, gírah, ukthâ´, and mánma, VI, 38, 4, &c.
Note 2. Sám, which I have here translated by sweet, is a difficult word to render. It is used as a substantive, as an adjective, and as an adverb; and in several instances it must remain doubtful whether it was meant for one or the other. The adverbial character is almost always, if not always, applicable, though in English there is no adverb of such general import as sám, and we must therefore render it differently, although we are able to perceive that in the mind of the poet it might still have been conceived as an adverb, in the sense of 'well.' I shall arrange the principal passages in which sám occurs according to the verbs with which it is construed.
1. With bhû:
VIII, 79, 7. bháva nah soma sám hridé.
Be thou, Soma, well (pleasant) to our heart. Cf. VIII,
82, 3.
VIII, 48, 4. sám nah bhava hridé â´ pîtáh indo (íti).
p. 191
Be thou well (sweet) to our heart, when drunk, O Soma! Cf. X, 9, 4.
I, 90, 9. sám nah bhavatu aryamâ´.
May Aryaman be well (kind) to us!
VI, 74, 1. sám nah bhûtam dvi-páde sám kátuh-pade.
May Soma and Rudra be well (kind) to our men and cattle.
Here sám might be rendered as an adverb, or as an adjective, or even as a substantive, in the sense of health or blessing.
Cf. VII, 54, I; IX, 69, 7. The expression dvipád and kátuh-pad is curiously like what occurs in the prayers of the Eugubian tables, Fisovie Sansie, ditu ocre Fisi, tote Jovine, ocrer Fisie, totar Jovinar dupursus, peturpursus fato fito (Umbrische Sprachdenkmäler, ed. Aufrecht, p. 198); and also in the edicts of Piyadasi, dupada-katupadesu pakhivâlikalesu, 'aux bipèdes, aux quadrupèdes, aux volatiles, aux animaux qui se meuvent dans les eaux.' See Burnouf, Lotus, p. 667.
II, 38, 11. sám yát stotrí-bhyah âpáye bhávâti.
What may be well (a pleasure) for the praisers, for the friend.
X, 37, 10. sám nah bhava kákshasâ.
Be kind to us with thy light!
2. With as:
VIII, 17, 6. sómah sám astu te hridé.
May the Soma be well (agreeable) to thy heart!
I, 5, 7. sám te santu prá-ketase.
May the Somas be well (pleasing) to thee, the wise!
V, 11, 5. túbhyam manîshâ´ iyám astu sám hridé.
May this prayer be well (acceptable) to thy heart!
I, 114, 1. yáthâ sám ásat dvi-páde kátuh-pade.
That it may be well for our men and cattle. Cf. X, 165, I; 3.
VII, 86, 8. sám nah kshéme sám ûm (íti) yóge nah astu.
May it be well with us in keeping and acquiring!
V, 7, 9. â´ yáh te—agne sám ásti dhâ´yase.
He who is lief to thee to support, i. e. he whom thou likest to support.
V, 74, 9. sám ûm (íti) sú vâm—asmâ´kam astu karkritíh.
Let there be happiness to you—glory to us!
p. 192
3. With as or bhû understood:
VI, 45, 22. sám yát gáve ná sâkíne.
A song which is pleasant to the mighty Indra, as food to an ox.
VIII, 13, 11. sám ít hí te.
For it is well for thee.
X, 86, 15. mantháh te indra sám hridé.
The mixture is pleasant to thy heart, O Indra!
X, 97, 18. áram kâ´mâya, sám hridé.
Enough for love, pleasant to the heart.
VI, 34, 3. sám tát asmai.
That is pleasant to him.
VI, 21, 4. káh te yagñáh mánase sám várâya.
What sacrifice seems to thy mind pleasant to select?
4. With kar:
I, 43, 6. sám nah karati árvate.
May he do well to our horse, i. e. may he benefit our horses.
IV, I, 3. tokâ´ya tugé—sám kridhi.
Do good to our children and progeny, or bless us for the procreation of children.
VIII, 18, 8. sám nah karatah asvinâ.
May the two Asvins do us good!
5. With vah:
I, 157, 3. sám nah â´ vakshat dvi-páde kátuh-pade.
May he bring blessing to us for man and cattle.
VIII, 5, 20. téna nah—pásve tokâ´ya sám gáve, váhatam pî´varîh íshah.
Bring to us rich food, a blessing to cattle, to children, and to the ox.
6. With verbs, such as pû, vâ, and others, where it is clearly used as an adverb:
IX, II, 3. sáh nah pavasva sám gáve sám gánâya sám árvate, sám râgan óshadhîbhyah.
Do thou, king Soma, stream upon us, a blessing for the ox, a blessing for man, a blessing for the horse, a blessing for the plants. Cf. IX, 11, 7; 60, 4; 61, 15; 109, 5.
VII, 35, 4. sám nah ishiráh abhí vâtu vâ´tah.
p. 193
May the brisk wind blow kindly upon us, or blow a blessing upon us!
VII, 35, 6. sám nah tváshtâ gnâ´bhih ihá srinotu.
May Tvashtar with the goddesses hear us here well, i. e. auspiciously!
VII, 35, 8. sám nah sû´ryah—út etu.
May the sun rise auspiciously for us!
VIII, 18, 9. sám nah tapatu sûryah.
May the sun warm us well!
III, 13, 6. sám nah soka—ágne.
Shine well for us, O Agni!
Sám Yóh.
Sám also occurs in a phrase that has puzzled the interpreters of the Veda very much, viz. sám yóh. These are two words, and must both be taken as substantives, though originally they may have been adverbs. Their meaning seems to have been much the same, and in English they may safely be rendered by health and wealth, in the old acceptation of these words:
I, 93, 7. dhattam yágamânâya sám yóh.
Give, Agni and Soma, to the sacrificer health and wealth.
I, 106, 5. sám yóh yát te mánuh-hitam tát îmahe.
Brihaspati, we ask for health and wealth which thou gavest to Manu.
I, 114, 2. yát sám ka yóh ka mánuh â-yegé pitâ´ tát asyâma táva rudra prá-nîtishu.
Rudra, the health and wealth which Manu, the father, obtained, may we reach it under thy guidance.
II, 33, 13. yâ´ni mánuh ávrinîta pitâ´ nah tâ´ sám ka yóh ka rudrásya vasmi.
The medicines which our father Manu chose, those I desire, the health and wealth of Rudra.
I, 189, 2. bháva tokâ´ya tánayâya sám yóh.
Be to our offspring health and wealth!
IV, 12, 5. yákkha tokâ´ya tánayâya sám yóh.
Give to our offspring health and wealth!
V, 69, 3. î´le tokâya tánayâya sám yóh.
I ask for our offspring health and wealth,
p. 194
VI, 50, 7. dhâ´ta tokâ´ya tánayâya sám yóh.
Give to our offspring health and wealth!
X, 182, I. átha karat yágamânâya sám yóh.
May he then produce for the sacrificer health and wealth.
VII, 69, 5. téna nah sám yóh—ní asvinâ vahatam.
On that chariot bring to us, Asvins, health and wealth.
III, 17, 3. átha bhava yágamânâya sám yóh.
Then, Agni, be health and wealth to the sacrificer.
III, 18, 4. brihát váyah sasamânéshu dhehi, revát agne visvâ´mitreshu sám yóh.
Give, Agni, much food to those who praise thee, give to the Visvâmitras richly health and wealth.
X, 15, 4. átha nah sám yóh arapáh dadhâta.
And give us health and wealth without a flaw! Cf. X, 59, 8.
X, 37, 11. tát asmé sám yóh arapáh dadhâtana.
And give to us health and wealth without a flaw!
V, 47, 7. tát astu mitra-varunâ tát agne sám yóh asmábhyam idám astu sastám.
Let this, O Mitra-Varuna, let this, O Agni, be health and wealth to us; may this be auspicious!
V, 53, 14. vrishtvî´ sám yóh â´pah usrí bheshagám syâ´ma marutah sahá.
Let us be together with you, O Maruts, after health, wealth, water, and medicine have been showered down in the morning.
VIII, 39, 4. sám ka yóh ka máyah dadhe.
He gave health, wealth, and happiness.
VIII, 71, 15. agnim sám yóh ka dâ´tave.
We ask Agni to give us health and wealth.
X, 9, 4. sám yóh abhí sravantu nah.
May the waters come to us, as health and wealth, or may they run towards us auspiciously.
Note 3. If we retain the reading of the MSS. sûshmah iyarti, we must take it as an independent phrase, and translate it by 'my strength rises.' For sûshma, though in this and other places it is frequently explained as an adjective, meaning powerful, is, as far as I can see, always a substantive, and means breath, strength. There may be a few passages in which, as there occur several words for strength, it might
p. 195
be possible to translate súshma by strong. But even there it is better to keep to the general meaning of súshma, and translate it as a substantive.
Iyarti means to rise and to raise. It is particularly applied to prayers raised by the poet in honour of the gods, and the similes used in connection with this, show clearly what the action implied by iyarti really is. For instance,
I, 116, 1. stómân iyarmi abhríyâ-iva vâ´tah.
I stir up hymns as the wind stirs the clouds.
X, 116, 9. su-vakasyâ´m iyarmi síndhau-iva prá îrayam nâ´vam arkaíh.
I stir up sweet praise, as if I rowed a ship on the river with hymns.
In the sense of rising it occurs,
X, 140, 2. pâvaká-varkâh sukrá-varkâh ánûna-varkâh út iyarshi bhânúnâ.
Thou risest up with splendour, Agni, thou of bright, resplendent, undiminished majesty.
We might therefore safely translate in our verse 'my strength rises,' although it is true that such a phrase does not occur again, and that in other passages where iyarti and súshma occur together, the former governs the latter in the accusative. Cf. IV, 17, 12; X, 75, 3.
Mahîdhara translates, my held-up thunderbolt moves on destroying everything,' but he admits another rendering in which adri would mean the stone used for pressing the Soma.
Verse 5.
Note 1. If, as we can hardly avoid, we ascribe this verse to. the Maruts, we must recognise in it the usual offer of help to Indra on the part of the Maruts. The question then only is, who are the strong friends in whose company they appear? It would be well if one could render antamébhih by horses, as Sâyana does, but there is no authority for it. Svá-kshatra is an adjective, meaning endowed with independent strength, synonymous with svá-tavas, I, 166, 2. It is applied to the mind of Indra, I, 54, 3; V, 3, 4; to the Maruts, V, 48, 1, but never to horses. As it stands, we can only suppose that a distinction is made between the Maruts and their followers,
p. 196
and that after calling together their followers, and adorning themselves for battle, they proceed to harness their chariots. Cf. I, 107, 2.
Note 2. Etân, in all MSS. which I consulted, has here the accent on the first syllable, and Professor Aufrecht ought not to have altered the word into etâ´n. If the accent had not been preserved by the tradition of the schools, the later interpreters would certainly have taken etân for the demonstrative pronoun. As it is, in spite of accent and termination, Sâyana in I, 166, 10, seems to take étâh for eté. In other passages, however, Sâyana, too, has perceived the difference, and in I, 169, 6, he explains the word very fully as prishadvarnâ gantâro vâ asvâ vâ. In this passage the Etas are clearly the deer of the Maruts, the Prishatîs:
I, 169, 6. ádha yát eshâm prithu-budhnâ´sah étâh.
In the next verse, however, éta seems applied to the Maruts themselves:
I, 169, 7. práti ghorâ´nâm étânâm ayâ´sâm marútâm srinve â-yatâ´m upabdíh.
The sound of the terrible, speckled, indefatigable Maruts is heard, as they approach; unless we translate:
The noise of the terrible deer of the indefatigable Maruts is heard, as they approach.
In I, 166, 10, ámseshu étâh, I adopt Professor Roth's conjecture, that étâh means the skins of the fallow deer, so that we should have to translate: On their shoulders are the deer-skins.
In the other passages where éta occurs it is used as a simile only, and therefore throws no light on the relation of the Etas to the Maruts. In both passages, however (V, 54, 5; X, 77, 2), the simile refers to the Maruts, though to their speed only, and not to their colour.
Note 3. Máhah-bhih, which I have translated 'with all our might,' seems to be used almost as an adverb, mightily or quickly (makshu), although the original meaning, with our powers, through our might, is likewise applicable. The original meaning is quite perceptible in passages like
V, 62, 3. ádhârayatam prithivî´m utá dyâ´m mítra-râgânâ varunâ máhah-bhih.
p. 197
Kings Mitra and Varuna, you have supported heaven and earth by your powers.
VII, 3, 7. tébhih nah agne ámitaih máhah-bhih satám pûrbhíh â´yasîbhih ví pâhi.
With those immeasurable powers, O Agni, protect us, with a hundred iron strongholds.
I, 90, 2. té—máhah-bhih, vratâ´ rakshante visvâ´hâ.
They always protect the laws by their powers.
VII, 71, 1. tvám nah agne máhah-bhih pâhí.
Protect us, Agni, with thy power.
In other passages, however, we see máhah-bhih used of the light or of the flames of Agni and of the dawn:
IV, 14, 1. deváh rókamânah máhah-bhih.
Agni, the god, brilliant with his powers.
VI, 64, 2. devi rókamânâ máhah-bhih.
O goddess, brilliant with thy powers.
The powers of the Maruts are referred to by the same name in the following passages:
V, 58, 5. prá-pra gâyante—máhah-bhih.
The Maruts are born with their powers.
VII, 58, 2. prá yé máhah-bhih ógasâ utá sánti.
The Maruts who excel in power and strength. Cf. III, 4, 6.
Verse 6.
Note 1. Indra in this dialogue is evidently represented as claiming everything for himself alone. He affects contempt for the help proffered by the Maruts, and seems to deny that he was at any time beholden to their assistance. By asking, Where was that custom that I should be with you and you with me in battle? he implies that it was not always their custom, and that he can dispense with their succour now. He wants to be alone, as in his former battle with Ahi, and does not wish that they should join him (cf. I, 33, 4). Professor Roth takes sam-ádhatta in the sense of implicating, but it can hardly be said that the Maruts ever implicated Indra in his fight against Ahi. Certainly this is not in keeping with the general tenor of this dialogue where, on the contrary, Indra shuns the
p. 198
company of the Maruts. But while on this point I differ from Professor Roth, I think he has rightly interpreted the meaning of ánamam. Out of the four passages in which badhasnaíh occurs, it is three times joined with nam, and every time has the sense of to bend away from, to escape from. See also Sonne, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xii, p. 348.
Verse 7.
Note 1. See VII, 39, 6. sakshîmáhi yúgyebhih nú devaíh.
Note 2. The last words leave no doubt as to their meaning, for the phrase is one of frequent occurrence. The only difficulty is the vocative marutah, where we should expect the nominative. It is quite possible, however, that the Maruts should here address themselves, though, no doubt, it would be easy to alter the accent. As to the phrase itself, see
VIII, 61, 4. táthâ ít asat índra krátvâ yáthâ vásah.
May it be so, O Indra, as thou mayest desire by thy mind.
VIII, 66, 4. vagrî´—ít karat índrah krátvâ yáthâ vásat.
May Indra with the thunderbolt act as he may desire in his mind. Cf. VIII, 20, 17; 28, 4, &c.
Verse 8.
Note 1. Here again Indra claims everything for himself, denying that the Maruts in any way assisted him while performing his great deeds. These deeds are the killing of Vritra, who withholds the waters, i. e. the rain from the earth, and the consequent liberation of the waters, so that they flow down freely for the benefit of Manu, that is, of man.
When Indra says that he slew Vritra indriyéna, he evidently chooses that word with a purpose, and we must therefore translate it here, not only by might, but by Indra's peculiar might. Indriyá, as derived from índra, means originally Indra-hood, then power in general, just as verethraghna in Zend means victory in general, though originally it meant the slaying of Vritra.
On bádhîm, see Bollensen, Z. D. M. G. XXII, p. 594.
p. 199
[paragraph continues]
He takes bádhîm for a contraction of badhisham, in analogy with badhîs and badhît. He refers to akramîm, X, 166, 5, and badhîm, X, 28, 7.
Verse 9.
Note 1. Ánutta, in the sense of 'not shaken,' not shakeable, inébranlable, is strange; likewise the genitive, where we expect the instrumental. Still, nud, by itself, occurs in similar phrases, e. g. VI, 17, 5, nutthâ´h ákyutam, thou shookest what is unshakeable, which might have been expressed by ákukyavah ánuttam, and I cannot bring myself to believe that in our passage Aufrecht's conjectural emendation is called for. He (K. Z. XXVI, 611) takes ánutta for ánudatta, like pratta for pradatta, &c., and proposes to omit the negative particle, translating the verse: 'Certainly it is conceded to thee, there is none among the gods like unto thee.'
But though I cannot adopt this emendation here, I think that in other passages Aufrecht's rendering of ánutta is far more appropriate than to take it for a-nutta; for instance, I, 80, 7; III, 31, 13; VII, 34, 11.
There remains one verse in which anutta seems to mean not shaken, not overcome, namely, VIII, 90, 5, tvám vritrâ´ni hamsi apratî´ni ékah ít ánuttâ karshani-dhrítâ, thou, being alone, killest the irresistible enemies with the thunderbolt (?). However, anudâ, in the sense of conceding, yielding, nachgeben, is certainly a very familiar idea in Vedic poetry.
II, 12, 10. yáh sárdhate ná anu-dádâti sridhyâ´m, who does not forgive the hurter his hurt.
I, 53, 8; II, 21, 4; 23, 11; X, 38, 5, Indra is called ananudáh, not yielding, not surrendering.
We must therefore admit two anuttas, one á-nutta, the other ánu(da)tta. In ánutta-manyu I prefer the former, 'of irresistible fury,' while Aufrecht prefers the latter, 'of recognised, or universally-admitted fury.'
Note 2. Devátâ in the ordinary sense of a deity never occurs in the Rig-veda. The word, in fact, as a feminine substantive occurs but twice, and in the tenth Mandala
p. 200
only. But even there it does not mean deity. In X, 24, 6, devâh devátayâ means, O gods, by your godhead, i. e. by your divine power. In X, 98, 1, bríhaspate práti me devátâm ihi, I take devátâ in the same sense as devátâti, and translate, O Brihaspati, come to my sacrifice.
In all other places where devátâ occurs in the Rig-veda it is a local adverb, and means among the gods. I shall only quote those passages in which Professor Roth assigns to devátâ a different meaning:
I, 55, 3. prá vîryẽna devátâ áti kekite.
He is pre-eminent among the gods by his strength.
I, 22, 5. sáh kéttâ devátâ padám.
He knows the place among the gods.
I, 100, 15. nâ yásya devâ´h devátâ ná mártâh â´pah kaná sâvasah ántam âpúh.
He, the end of whose power neither the gods among the gods, nor mortals, nor even the waters have reached.
Here the translation of devátâ in the sense of 'by their godhead,' would be equally applicable, yet nothing would be gained as, in either case, devátâ is a weak repetition.
VI, 4, 7. índram ná tvâ sávasâ devátâ vâyúm prinanti râ´dhasâ nrí-tamâh.
The best among men celebrate thee, O Agni, as like unto Indra in strength among the gods, as like unto Vâyu in liberality. See also devatâti, VIII, 74, 3; X, 8, 2.
Note 3. The juxta-position of gâ´yamânah and gâtáh would seem to show that, if the latter had a past, the former had a future meaning. To us, 'No one who will be born and no one who has been born,' would certainly sound more natural. The Hindu, however, is familiar with the idea as here expressed, and in order to comprehend all beings, he speaks of those who are born and those who are being born. Thus in a Padasishta of the Pâvamânîs (IX, 67) we read:


Note 4. Karishyâ´ is written in all the MSS. without a
p. 201
[paragraph continues]
Visarga, and unless we add the Visarga on our own authority, we should have to take it as an entirely anomalous acc. plur. neut. of a passive participle of the future, karishyám standing for kâryãm, faciendum. It is much easier, however, to explain this form if we add the Visarga, and read karishyâ´h, which would then be a second person singular of a Vedic conjunctive of the future. This form occurs at least once more in the Veda:
IV, 30, 23. utá nûnám yát indriyám karishyâ´h indra paúmsyam, adyá nákih tát â´ minat.
O Indra, let no man destroy to-day whatever manly feat thou art now going to achieve.
Verse 10.
Note 1. As I have translated these words, they sound rather abrupt. The meaning, however, would be clear enough, viz. almighty power belongs to me, therefore I can dare and do. If this abrupt expression should offend, it may be avoided, by taking the participle dadhrishvâ´n as a finite verb, and translating, Whatever I have been daring, I shall do according to my will.
Verse 11.
Note 1. In this verse Indra, after having declined with no uncertain sound the friendship of the Maruts, seems to repent himself of his unkindness towards his old friends. The words of praise which they addressed to him in verse 9, in spite of the rebuff they had received from Indra, have touched his heart, and we may suppose that, after this, their reconciliation was complete. The words of Indra are clear enough, the only difficulty occurs in the last words, which are so idiomatic that it is impossible to render them in English. In tanvẽ tanû´bhih, literally for the body by the bodies, tang is used like the pronoun self. Both must therefore refer to the same subject. We cannot translate 'for myself made by yourselves,' but must take the two words together, so that they should mean, 'the hymn which you have made for your own benefit and by your own exertions.'
p. 202
Verse 13.
Note 1. Spiegel, in his review, called my attention to the Zend api-vat, which Burnouf discussed in his 'Études,' p. 328. Burnouf tries to show that vat in Zend has the meaning of knowing, and that it occurs with the preposition api, in apivatahê and apivatâiti. If this is the same word as in Sanskrit, then apivâtayati would be a causative, meaning to make known. The meaning of vat, however, is doubtful in Zend, and hardly appropriate in the few passages where it occurs in the Veda. Roth, in the Dictionary, explains vat by verstehn, begreifen, the causative by begreiflich machen; but in our passage he translates it by belebend, Ludwig by aufspürend. Till we get more light, I shall feel content to translate apivat by to approach, to obtain, and the causative by to make approach, to invite, to welcome.
The following are the passages in which api-vat occurs:
VII, 3, 10. ápi krátum su-kétasam vatema.
May we obtain an excellent understanding; not, Awaken in us a good sense.
VII, 60, 6. Api krátum su-kétasam vátantah.
They (Mitra and Varuna) obtaining an excellent understanding.
I, 128, 2. tám yagña-sâ´dham ápi vâtayâmasi.
Him, Agni, the performer of the sacrifice, we make approach, we invite.
X, 20, I; 25, 1. bhádram nah ápi vâtaya mánah, dáksham utá krátum.
Bring to us, i. e. give us, a good mind, and a strong understanding.
X, 13, 5. pitré putrâ´sah api avîvatan ritam.
The sons obtained the right for the father (an obscure verse).
As to svapivâta, VII, 46, 3, I should derive it from van, in the sense of implored, desired; see, however, Muir, Sanskrit Texts, IV, p. 314, note; Nirukta, ed. Roth, p. 135.
Note 2. On návedâh, see IV, 23, 4.
Verse 14.
Note 1. This is a verse which, without some conjectural
p. 203
alterations, it seems impossible to translate. Sâyana, of course, has a translation ready for it, so has M. Langlois, but both of them offend against the simplest rules of grammar and logic. The first question is, who is meant by asmâ´n (which is here used as an amphimacer), the sacrificers or the Maruts? The verb â´ kakré would well apply to the medhâ´ mânyásya, the hymn of Mânya, which is intended to bring the Maruts to the sacrifice, this bringing to the sacrifice being the very meaning of â kar. But then we have the vocative marutah in the next line, and even if we changed the vocative into the accusative, we should not gain much, as the Maruts could hardly call upon anybody to turn them towards the sage.
If, on the contrary, we admit that asmâ´n refers to those who offer the sacrifice, then we must make a distinction, which, it is true, is not an unusual one, between those who here speak of themselves in the first person, and who provide the sacrifice, and the poet Mândârya Mânya, who was employed by them to compose or to recite this hymn.
But even if we adopt this alternative, many difficulties still remain. First of all, we have to change the accent of kakré into kakre, which may seem a slight change, but is not the less objectionable when we consider that in our emendations of the Vedic hymns we must think rather of accidents that might happen in oral traditions than of the lapsus calami of later scribes. Secondly, we must suppose that the hymn of Mândârya Mânya ends with verse 13, sand that the last verses were supplied by the sacrificers themselves. Possibly the dialogue only, from verse 3 to verse 12, was the work of Mânya, and the rest added at some solemn occasion.
Other difficulties, however, remain. Duvasyâ´t is taken by Sâyana as an ablative of duvasyá, worthy of dúvas, i. e. of worship, of sacrifice. Unfortunately this duvasyá does not occur again, though it would be formed quite regularly, like namasyâ´, worthy of worship, from námas, worship.
If we take duvasyâ´t as the 3rd pers. sing. of the present in the Vedic conjunctive, we must also confess that this conjunctive does not occur again. But the verb duvasyati
p. 204
occurs frequently. It seems to have two meanings. It is derived from dúvas, which in the Vedic language means worship or sacrifice, just as karma, work, has assumed the special sense of sacrifice. Derived from dúvas in this sense, duvasyati means to worship. But dúvas meant originally any opus operatum. The root from which dúvas is derived, is lost in Sanskrit, but it exists in other languages. It must have been du or dû in the sense of acting, or sedulously working. It exists in Zend as du, to do, in Gothic as táujan, gataujan, Old High-German zawjan, Modern German zauen (Grimm, Gram. i2. p. 1041). The Gothic tavi, opus, Old High-German zouwi, Middle High-German gezöuwe (Grimm, Gram. iii. p. 499), come from the same source; and it is possible, too, that the Old Norse taufr, modern töfrar, incantamenta, the Old High-German zoupar, Middle High-German zouber, both neuter, and the modern Zauber, may find their explanation in the Sanskrit dúvas. Derived from dúvas, in the sense of work, we have duvasyati in the sense of helping, providing, the German schaffen and verschaffen.
In the sense of worshipping, duvasyati occurs,
III, 2, 8. duvasyáta—gâtá-vedasam.
Worship Gâtavedas.
V, 28, 6. â´ guhota duvasyáta agním.
Invoke, worship Agni. Cf. III, 13, 3; 1, 13.
III, 3, 1. agníh hí devâ´n—duvasyáti.
Agni performs the worship of the gods. Cf. VII, 82, 5.
I, 167, 6. sutá-somah duvasyán.
He who has poured out Soma and worships.
In many passages duvasyati is joined with an instrumental:
V, 42, 11. námah-bhih devám—duvasya.
Worship the god with praises.
I, 78, 2. tám u tvâ gótamah girâ´—duvasyati.
Gotama worships thee with a song.
V, 49, 2. su-uktaíh devám—duvasya.
Worship the god with hymns.
VI, 16, 46. vîtî´ yáh devám—duvasyét.
He who worships the god with a feast.
p. 205
X, 14, 1. yamám—havíshâ duvasya.
Worship Yama with an oblation.
VI, 15, 6. agním-agnim vah samídhâ duvasyata.
Worship Agni with your log of wood. Cf. VIII, 44, 1.
III, 1, 2. samít-bhih agním námasâ duvasyan.
They worshipped Agni with logs of wood, with praise.
In the more general and, I suppose, more original sense of caring for, attending, we find duvasyati:
III, 51, 3. anehásah stúbhah índrah duvasyati.
Indra provides for the matchless worshippers.
I, 112, 15. kalím yâ´bhih—duvasyáthah.
By the succours with which you help Kali. Cf. I, 112, 21.
I, 62, 10. duvasyánti svásârah áhrayânam.
The sisters attend the proud (Agni).
I, 119, 10. yuvám pedáve—svetám—duvasyathah.
You provide for Pedu the white horse.
If, then, we take duvasyati in the sense of working for, assisting, it may be with the special sense of assisting at a sacred act, like διακονεῖν; and if we take duvás, as it has the accent on the last syllable, as the performer of a sacrifice, we may venture to translate, 'that he should help, as the singer helps the performer of the sacrifice a': The singer or the poet may be called the assistant at a sacrifice, for his presence was not necessary at all sacrifices, the songs constituting an ornament rather than an essential part in most sacred acts. But though I think it right to offer this conjectural interpretation, I am far from supposing that it gives us the real sense of this difficult verse. Duvasyâ´t may be, as Sâyana suggests, an ablative of duvasyá; and duvasyá, like namasyâ´, if we change the accent, may mean he who is to be worshipped, or worshipping. In this way a different interpretation might suggest itself, though I confess I do not see that any other interpretation as yet suggested is satisfactory. Some happy thought may some day or other clear up this difficulty, when those who have

p. 206
toiled, but toiled in a wrong direction, will receive scant thanks for the trouble they have taken. See Bollensen, Z. D. M. G. XVIII, p. 606.
Note 2. In the second line, the words ó sú varta remind us of similar phrases in the Veda, but we want an accusative, governed by varta; whereas marutah, to judge from its accent, can only be a vocative. Thus we read:
I, 138, 4. ó (íti) sú tvâ vavritîmahi stómebhih.
May we turn thee quickly hither by our praises!
VIII, 7, 83. ó (íti) sú vríshnah—vavrityâ´m.
May I turn the heroes quickly hither!
Compare also passages like III, 33, 8:
ó (íti) sú svasârah kâráve srinota.
Listen quickly, O sisters, to the poet.
I, 139, 7. ó (íti) sú nah agne srinuhi.
Hear us quickly, O Agni.
Cf. I, 182, 1; II, 34, 15; VII, 59, 5; VIII, 2, 19; X, 179, 2.
Unless we change the accent, we must translate, 'Bring hither quickly!' and we must take these words as addressed to the kârú, the poet, whose hymn is supposed to attract the gods to the sacrifice. By a quick transition, the next words, marutah vípram ákkha, would then have to be taken as addressed to the gods, 'Maruts, on to the sage!' and the last words would become intelligible by laying stress on the vah, 'for you, and not for Indra or any other god, has the singer recited these hymns.' See, however, Preface, p. xxi.
Verse 15.
Note 1. I translate Mânya, the son of Mâna, because the poet, so called in I, 189, 8, is in all probability the same as our Mândârya Mânya. But it may also be Mânya, the descendant of Mandâri. The Mânas are mentioned I, 172, 5;182, 8.
Note 2. Vâg.. S. XXXIV, 48. The second line is difficult, owing to the uncertain meaning of vayâ´m.
Â´ ishâ´ a yâsîshta has been rendered, 'Come hither with

p. 207
water or drink or rain,' yâsîshta being the aorist without the augment and with the intermediate vowel lengthened. The indicative occurs in
V, 58, 6. yát prá áyâsishta príshatîbhih ásvaih.
When you Maruts came forth with your fallow deer and your horses.
But what is the meaning of vayâ´m? Vayâ´ means a germ, a sprout, an offshoot, a branch, as may be seen from the following passages:
II, 5, 4. vidvâ´n asya vratâ´ dhruvâ´ vayâ´h-iva ánu rohate.
He who knows his eternal laws, springs up like young sprouts. (Better vayâ´-iva.)
VI, 7, 6. tásya ít ûm (íti) vísvâ bhúvanâ ádhi mûrdháni vayâ´h-iva ruruhuh.
From above the head of Vaisvanara all worlds have grown; like young sprouts.
VIII, 13, 6. stotâ´—vayâ´h-iva ánu rohate. (Better vayâ´-iva.)
The worshipper grows up like young sprouts.
VIII, 13, 17. índram kshonî´h avardhayan vayâ´h-iva.
The people made Indra to grow like young sprouts.
VIII, 19, 33. yásya te agne anyé agnáyah upa-kshítah vayâ´h-iva.
Agni, of whom the other fires are like parasitical shoots.
I, 59, 1. vayâ´h ít agne agnáyah te anyé.
O Agni, the other fires are indeed offshoots of thee.
II, 35, 8. vayâ´h ít anyâ´ bhúvanâni asya.
The other worlds are indeed his (the rising sun's) offshoots.
VI, 13, 1. tvát vísvâ—saúbhagâni ágne ví yanti vanínah ná vayâ´h.
From thee O Agni, spring all happinesses, as the sprouts of a tree.
VI, 24, 3. vrikshásya nú (ná?) te—vayâ´h ví ûtáyah ruruhuh.
Succours sprang from thee, like the branches of a tree.
V, 1, 1. yahvâ´h-iva prá vayâ´m ut-gíhânâh prá bhânávah sisrate nâ´kam ákkha.
Like birds (?) flying up to a branch, the flames of Agni went up to heaven; (or like strong men reaching up to.)
p. 208
VI, 57, 5. tâ´m pûshnáh su-matím vayám vrikshásya prá vayâ´m-iva índrasya ka â´ rabhâmahe.
Let us reach this favour of Pûshan and of Indra, as one reaches forth to the branch of a tree.
There remain some doubtful passages in which vayâ´ occurs, VII, 40, 5, and X, 92, 3; 134, 6. In the first passage, as in our own, vayâ´h is trisyllabic.
If vayâ´ can be used in the sense of offshoot or sprout, we may conclude that the same word, used in the singular, might mean offspring, particularly when joined with tanvẽ. 'Give a branch to our body,' would be understood even in languages less metaphorical than that of the Vedas; and as the prayer for 'olive branches' is a constant theme of the Vedic poets, the very absence of that prayer here, might justify us in assigning this sense to vayâ´m. In VI, 2, 5, the expression vayâ´vantam ksháyam, a house with branches, means the same as nrivántam, a house with children and men. See M. M., On Βίος and váyas, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xv, p. 215. Benfey (Endungen in îans, p. 37) takes vayâm as a genitive plural, referring it to the Maruts, as closely connected with each other, like branches of a tree. This is much the same interpretation as that of Mahîdhara (VS. XXXIV, 48), who translates 'come near for the body, i. e. for the bodily strength of the fellows, the Maruts.' Ludwig takes it as a possible instrumental of vayam.
It is preferable, however, to take yâsîshta as a precative Âtm., in order to account for the long î, and to accept it as a third person singular, referring to stómah.
Note 3. Vrigána means an enclosure, a νομός, whether it be derived from vrig, to ward off; like arx from arcere, or from vrig, in the sense of clearing, as in vrikta-barhis, barhíh prá. vriñge, I, 116, 1. In either case the meaning remains much the same, viz. a field, cleared for pasture or agriculture,—a clearing, as it is called in America, or a camp,—enclosed with hurdles or walls, so as to be capable of defence against wild animals or against enemies. In this sense, however, vrigana is a neuter, while as a masculine it means powerful, invigorating. See Preface, p. xx.
"
16,"MANDALA I, HYMN 166.","ASHTAKA II, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 1-3.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. Let us now proclaim for the robust 1 host, for the herald 2 of the powerful (Indra), their ancient greatness! O ye strong-voiced Maruts, you heroes, prove your powers on your march, as with a torch, as with a sword 3!
2. Like parents bringing a dainty to 1 their own 2 son, the wild (Maruts) play playfully at the sacrifices. The Rudras reach the worshipper with their protection, strong in themselves, they do not fail the sacrificer.
3. For him to whom the immortal guardians have given fulness of wealth, and who is himself a giver of oblations, the Maruts, who gladden men with the milk (of rain), pour out, like friends, many clouds.
4. You who have stirred 1 up the clouds with might, your horses rushed 2 forth, self-guided. All beings who dwell in houses 3 are afraid of you, your march is brilliant with your spears thrust forth.
5. When they whose march is terrible have caused the rocks to tremble 1, or when the manly Maruts have shaken the back of heaven, then every lord of the forest fears at your racing, each shrub flies out of your way 2, whirling like chariot-wheels 3.
6. You, O terrible Maruts, whose ranks are never broken, favourably 1 fulfil our prayer 2! Wherever your gory-toothed 3 lightning bites 4, it crunches 5 cattle, like a well-aimed bolt 6.
p. 210
7. The Maruts whose gifts are firm, whose bounties are never ceasing, who do not: revile 1, and who are highly praised at the sacrifices, they sing their song 2 for to drink the sweet juice: they know the first manly deeds of the hero (Indra).
8. The man whom you have guarded, O Maruts,—shield him with hundredfold strongholds from injury 1 and mischief,—the man whom you, O fearful, powerful singers, protect from reproach in the prosperity of his children.
9. On your chariots, O Maruts, there are all good things, strong weapons 1 are piled up clashing against each other. When you are on your journeys, you carry the rings 2 on your shoulders, and your axle turns the two wheels at once 3.
10. In their manly arms there are many good things, on their chests golden chains 1, flaring 2 ornaments, on their shoulders speckled deer-skins 3, on their fellies sharp edges 4; as birds spread their wings, they spread out splendours behind.
11. They, mighty by might, all-powerful powers 1, visible from afar like the heavens 2 with the stars, sweet-toned, soft-tongued singers with their mouths 3, the Maruts, united with Indra, shout all around.
12. This is your greatness 1 O well-born Maruts!—your bounty 3 extends far, as the sway 2 of Aditi 4. Not even 5 Indra in his scorn 6 can injure that bounty, on whatever man you have bestowed it for his good deeds.
13. This is your kinship (with us), O Maruts, that you, immortals, in former years have often protected the singer 1. Having through this prayer granted a hearing to man, all these heroes together have become well-known by their valiant deeds.
p. 211
14. That we may long flourish, O Maruts, with your wealth, O ye racers, that our men may spread in the camp, therefore let me achieve the rite with these offerings.
15. May this praise, O Maruts, this song of Mândârya, the son of Mâna, the poet, ask you with food for offspring for ourselves! May we have an invigorating autumn, with quickening rain!
p. 212
NOTES.
This hymn is ascribed to Agastya, the reputed son of Mitrâvarunau, and brother of Vasishtha. The metre in verses 1-13 is Gagatî, in 14, 15 Trishtubh. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB.
Verse 1.
Note 1. Rabhasá, an adjective of rábhas, and this again from the root rabh, to rush upon a thing, â-rabh, to begin a thing. From this root rabh we have the Latin robur, in the general sense of strength, while in rabies the original meaning of impetuous motion has been more clearly preserved. The Greek λάβρος, too, as pointed out by Cowell, comes from this root. In the Vedic Sanskrit, derivatives from the root rabh convey the meaning both of quickness and of strength. Quickness in ancient languages frequently implies strength, and strength implies quickness, as we see, for instance, from the German snël, which, from meaning originally strong, comes to mean in modern German quick, and quick only. The German bald again, meaning soon, comes from the Gothic balths, the English bold. Thus we read:
I, 145, 3. sísuh â´ adatta sám rábhah.
The child (Agni) acquired vigour.
Indra is called rabhah-dâ´h, giver of strength; and rabhasá, vigorous, is applied not only to the Maruts, who in V, 58, 5, are called rábhishthâh, the most vigorous, but also to Agni, II, 10, 4, and to Indra, III, 31, 12.
In the sense of rabid, furious, it occurs in
X, 95, 14. ádha enam vríkâh rabhasâ´sah adyúh.
May rabid wolves eat him!
In the next verse rabhasá, the epithet of the wolves, is replaced by ásiva, which means unlucky, uncanny.
In our hymn rabhasá occurs once more, and is applied there, in verse 10, to the añgí or glittering ornaments of the Maruts. Here Sâyana translates it by lovely, and it was most likely intended to convey the idea of lively or brilliant splendour, though it may mean also strong. See also IX, 96, 1.
p. 213
Note 2. Ketú, derived from an old root ki, in Sanskrit ki, to perceive, from which also kitra, conspicuous, ken-speckled, beautiful, means originally that by which a thing is perceived or known, whether a sign, or a flag, or a herald. It is the Gothic haidu, species. It then takes the more general sense of light and splendour. In our passage, herald seems to me the most appropriate rendering, though B. and R. prefer the sense of banner. The Maruts come before Indra, they announce the arrival of Indra, they are the first of his army.
Note 3. The real difficulty of our verse lies in the two comparisons aidhâ´-iva and yudhâ´-iva. Neither of them occurs again in the Rig-veda. B. and R. explain aidhâ´ as an instrumental of aídh, flaming, or flame, and derive it from the root idh, to kindle, with the preposition â. Professor Bollensen in his excellent article Zur Herstellung des Veda (Orient and Occident, vol. iii, p. 473) says: 'The analysis of the text given in the Pada, viz. aidhâ´-iva and yudhâ´-iva, is contrary to all sense. The common predicate is tavishâ´ni kartana, exercise your power, you roarers, i. e. blow as if you meant to kindle the fire on the altar, show your power as if you went to battle. We ought therefore to read aidhé va and yudhé | va. Both are infinitives, aidh is nothing but the root idh + â, to kindle, to light.' Now this is certainly a very ingenious explanation, but it rests on a supposition which I cannot consider as proved, viz. that in the Veda, as in Pâli, the comparative particle iva may be changed, as shown in the preface to the first edition, to va. It must be admitted that the two short syllables of iva are occasionally counted in the Veda as one, but yudhé-iva, though it might become yudhá iva, would never in the Veda become yudhéva.
As yudhâ´ occurs frequently in the Veda, we may begin by admitting that the parallel form aidh must be explained in analogy to yudhâ´. Now yúdh is a verbal noun and means fighting. We have the accusative yúdham, I, 53, 7; the genitive yudháh, VIII, 27, 17; the dative yudhé, I, 61, 13; the locative yudhí, I, 8, 3; the instrumental yudhâ´, I, 53, 7, &c.; loc. plur. yut-sú, I, 91, 21. As long as yúdh
p. 214
retains the general predicative meaning of fighting, some of these cases may be called infinitives. But yúdh soon assumes not only the meaning of battle, battle-ground, but also of instrument of fighting, weapon. In another passage, X, 103, 2, yúdhah may be taken as a vocative plural, meaning fighters. Passages in which yúdh means clearly weapon, are, for instance,
V, 52, 6. â´ rukmaíh â´ yudhâ´ nárah rishvâ´h rishtî´h asrikshata.
With their bright chains, with their weapon, the tall men have stretched forth the spears.
X, 55, 8. pîtvî´ sómasya diváh â´ vridhânáh sû´rah níh yudhâ´ adhamat dásyûn.
The hero, growing, after drinking the Soma, blew away from the sky the enemies with his weapon. See also X, 103, 4.
I therefore take yúdh in our passage also in the sense of weapon or sword, and, in accordance with this, I assign to aídh the meaning of torch. Whether aídh comes from idh with the preposition â, which, after all, would only give edh, or whether we have in the Sanskrit aídh the same peculiar strengthening which this very root shows in Greek and Latin a, would be difficult to decide. The torch of the Maruts is the lightning, the weapon the thunderbolt, and by both they manifest their strength; ferro et igne, as Ludwig remarks.
Wilson: We proclaim eagerly, Maruts, your ancient greatness, for (the sake of inducing) your prompt appearance, as the indication of (the approach of) the showerer (of benefits). Loud-roaring and mighty Maruts, you exert your vigorous energies for the advance (to the sacrifice), as if it was to battle.
Verse 2.
Note 1. That úpa can be construed with the accusative is clear from many passages:
III, 35, 2. úpa imám yagñám â´ vahâtah índram.
Bring Indra to this sacrifice!
I, 25, 4. váyah ná vasatî´h úpa.
As birds (fly) to their nests.

p. 215
Note 2. Nítya, from ni + tya a, means originally what is inside, internus, then what is one's own; and is opposed to níshtya, from nis + tya, what is outside, strange, or hostile. Nítya has been well compared with nigá, literally eingeboren, then, like nítya, one's own. What is inside, or in a thing or place, is its own, is peculiar to it, does not move or change, and hence the secondary meanings of nítya, one's own, unchanging, eternal. Thus we find nítya used in the sense of internal or domestic:
I, 73, 4. tám tvâ nárah dáme â´ nítyam iddhám ágne sákanta kshitíshu dhruvâ´su.
Our men worshipped thee, O Agni, lighted within the house in safe places.
This I believe to be a more appropriate rendering than if we take nítya in the sense of always, continuously lighted, or, as some propose, in the sense of eternal, everlasting.
VII, 1, 2. dakshâ´yyah yáh dáme â´sa nítyah.
Agni who is to be pleased within the house, i. e. as belonging to the house, and, in that sense, who is to be pleased always. Cf. I, 140, 7; 141, 2; X, 12, 2, and III, 25, 5, where nítyah, however, may have been intended as an adjective belonging to the vocative sûno.
Most frequently nítya occurs with sûnú, I, 66, 1; 185, 2; tánaya, III, 15, 2; X, 39, 14; toká, II, 2, 11; âpí, VII, 88, 6; páti, I, 71, 1, and has always the meaning of one's own, very much like the later Sanskrit niga, which never occurs in the Rig-veda, though it makes its appearance in the Âtharvana.
Níshtya, extraneus, occurs three times in the Rig-veda:
VI, 75, 19. yáh nah sváh áranah yáh ka níshtyah gíghâmsati.
Whoever wishes to hurt us, our own friend or a stranger from without.
X, 133, 5. yáh nah indra abhi-dâ´sati sá-nâbhih yáh ka níshtyah.
He who infests us, O Indra, whether a relative or a stranger.
VIII, I, 13. mâ´ bhûma níshtyâh-iva índra tvád áranâh-iva.

p. 216
Let us not be like outsiders, O Indra, not like strangers to thee.
Wilson: Ever accepting the sweet (libation), as (they would) a son, they sport playfully at sacrifices, demolishing (all intruders).
Ludwig: Wie einen nicht absterbenden Sohn das Madhu bringend.
Verse 4.
Note 1. Ávyata, a Vedic second aorist of vî (ag), to stir up, to excite. From it pravayana, a goad, pra-vetar, a driver. The Greek οἶ-σ-τρος, gad-fly, has been referred to the same root. See Fick, Wörterbuch, p. 170.
Roth (Wenzel, Instrumental, p. 54) translates: 'While you quickly throw yourselves into the mists;' from a verb vyâ.
Note 2. Adhragan, from dhrag, a root which, by metathesis of aspiration, would assume the form of dragh or dragh. In Greek, the final medial aspirate being hardened, reacts on the initial media, and changes it to t, as bâhu becomes πῆχυς, budh πυθ, bandh, πενθ. This would give us τρεχ, the Greek root for running, Goth. thrag-jan.
Note 3. Harmyá is used here as an adjective of bhúvana, and can only mean living in houses. It does not, however, occur again in the same sense, though it occurs several times as a substantive, meaning house. Its original meaning is fire-pit, then hearth, then house, a transition of meaning analogous to that of aedes. Most of the ancient nations begin their kitchen with a fire-pit. ‘They dig a hole in the ground, take a piece of the animal's raw hide, and press it down with their hands close to the sides of the hole, which thus becomes a sort of pot or basin. This they fill with water, and they make a number of stones red-hot in a fire close by. The meat is put into the water, and the stones dropped in till the meat is boiled. Catlin describes the process as awkward and tedious, and says that since the Assinaboins had learnt from the Mandans to make pottery, and had been supplied with vessels by the traders, they had entirely done away the custom, “excepting at public festivals; where they seem, like all others of the human family, to take pleasure in cherishing and perpetuating
p. 217
their ancient customs a.”’ This pit was called harmyá b or gharmá, which is the Latin formus. Thus we read:
VII, 56, 16. té harmye-sthâ´h sísavah ná subhrâ´h.
The Maruts bright like boys standing by the hearth.
From meaning fire-pit, or hearth, harmyá afterwards takes the more general sense of house:
VII, 55, 6. téshâm sám hanmah akshâ´ni yáthâ idám harmyám táthâ.
We shut their eyes as we shut this house (possibly, this oven).
VII, 76, 2. pratîkî´ â´ agât ádhi harmyébhyah.
The dawn comes near, over the house-tops.
X, 46, 3. gâtáh â´ harmyéshu.
Agni, born in the houses.
X, 73, 10. manyóh iyâya harmyéshu tasthau.
He came from Manyu, he remained in the houses.
In some of these passages harmyá might be taken in the sense of householder; but as harmyá in VII, 55, 6, has clearly the meaning of a building, it seems better not to assign to it unnecessarily any new significations.
If harmya or *harma meant originally a fire-pit, then a hearth, a house, we see the close connection between harma and gharma, harmya and gharmya. Thus by the side of harmyeshtha we find gharmyeshtha (RV. X, 106, 5). We find gharma meaning, not only heat in general, but fire-pit, hearth; and we find the same word used for what we should call the pit, a place of torture and punishment from which the gods save their worshippers, or into which they throw the evil-doers.
V, 32, 5. yûyutsantam támasi harmyé dhâ´h.


p. 218
When thou, Indra, hadst placed Sushna, who was anxious to fight, in the darkness of the pit.
In the next verse we find
asûryé támasi, in the ghastly darkness.
VIII, 5, 23. yuvám kánvâya nâsatyâ ápi-riptâya harmyé sásvat ûtî´h dasasyathah.
You, Nâsatyas, always grant your aid to Kanva when thrown into the pit.
This fiery pit into which Atri is thrown, and whence he, too, was saved by the Asvins, is likewise called gharmá, I, 112, 7; 119, 6; VIII, 73, 3; X, 80, 3.
Lastly we find:
X, 114, 10. yadâ´ yamáh bhávati harmyé hitáh.
When Yama is seated in the house, or in the nether world.
When the Pitars, too, the spirits of the departed, the Manes, are called gharma-sád, this is probably intended to mean, dwelling on the hearth (X, 15, 9 and 10), and not dwelling in the abode of Yama.

Verse 5.
Note 1. Nad certainly means to sound, and the causative might be translated by 'to make cry or shriek.' If we took párvata in the sense of cloud, we might translate, 'When you make the clouds roar;' if we took párvata for mountain, we might, with Professor Wilson, render the passage by 'When your brilliant coursers make the mountains echo.' But nad, like other roots which afterwards take the meaning of sounding, means originally to vibrate, to shake; and if we compare analogous passages where nad occurs, we shall see that in our verse, too, the Vedic poet undoubtedly meant nad to be taken in that sense:
VIII, 20, 5. ákyutâ kit vah ágman â´ nâ´nadati párvatâsah vánaspátih, bhû´mih yâ´meshu regate.
At your racing even things that are immovable vibrate, the rocks, the lord of the forest; the earth quivers on your ways. (See I, 37, 7, note I.) Grassmann here translates nadáyanta by erschüttern, but in VIII, 20, 5 by erdröhnt.
Note 2. See I, 37, 7, note 1.
p. 219
Note 3. Rathiyántî-iva does not occur again. Sâyana explains it, like a woman who wishes for a chariot, or who rides in a chariot. I join it with óshadhi, and take it in the sense of upamânâd âkâre (Pân. III, 1, 10), i. e. to behave like or to be like a chariot, whether the comparison is meant to express simply the quickness of chariots or the whirling of their wheels. The Pada has rathiyántî, whereas the more regular form is that of the Samhitâ, rathîyántî. Cf. Prâtisâkhya, 587.
Verse 6.
Note 1. Su-ketúnâ, the instrumental of su-ketú, kindness, good-mindedness, favour. This word occurs in the instrumental only, and always refers to the kindness of the gods; not, like sumatí, to the kindness of the worshipper also:
I, 79, 9. â´ nah agne su-ketúnâ rayím visvâ´yu-poshasam, mârdîkám dhehi gîváse.
Give us, O Agni, through thy favour wealth which supports our whole life, give us grace to live.
I, 127, 11. sáh nah nédishtham dádrisânah â´ bhara ágne devébhih sá-kanâh su-ketúnâ maháh râyáh su-ketûnâ.
Thou, O Agni, seen close to us, bring to us, in union with the gods, by thy favour, great riches, by thy favour!
I, 159, 5. asmábhyam dyâvâprithivî (íti) su-ketúnâ rayím dhattam vásu-mantam sata-gvínam.
Give to us, O Dyâvâprithivî, by your favour, wealth, consisting of treasures and many flocks.
V, 51, 11. svastí dyâvâprithivî (íti) su-ketúnâ.
Give us, O Dyâvâprithivî, happiness through your favour!
V, 64, 2. tâ´ bâhávâ su-ketúnâ prá yantam asmai árkate.
Stretch out your arms with kindness to this worshipper! In one passage of the ninth Mandala (IX, 65, 30) we meet with su-ketúnam, as an accusative, referring to Soma, the gracious, and this would pre-suppose a substantive ketúna, which, however, does not exist.
Note 2. Sumatí has, no doubt, in most passages in the Rig-veda, the meaning of favour, the favour of the gods. 'Let us obtain your favour, let us be in your favour,' are familiar expressions of the Vedic poets. But there are also numerous passages where that meaning is inapplicable, and
p. 220
where, as in our passage, we must translate sumatí by prayer or desire.
In the following passages sumatí is clearly used in its original sense of favour, blessing, or even gift:
I, 73, 6 (7). su-matím bhíkshamânâh.
Begging for thy favour.
I, 171, 1. su-ukténa bhikshe su-matím turâ´nâm.
With a hymn I beg for the favour of the quick Maruts.
I, 114, 3. asyâ´ma te su-matím.
May we obtain thy favour! Cf. I, 114, 9:
I, 114, 4. su-matím ít vayám asya â´ vrinîmahe.
We choose his favour. Cf. III, 33, 1.
I, 117, 23. sádâ kavî (íti) su-matím â´ kake vâm.
I always desire your favour, O ye wise Asvins.
I, 156, 3. maháh te vishno (íti) su-matím bhagâmahe.
May we, O Vishnu, enjoy the favour of thee, the mighty!
Bhiksh, to beg, used above, is an old desiderative form of bhag, and means to wish to enjoy.
III, 4, 1. su-matím râsi vásvah.
Thou grantest the favour of wealth.
VII, 39, 1. ûrdhváh agníh su-matím vásvah asret.
The lighted fire went up for the favour of wealth. Cf. VII, 60, 11; IX, 97, 26.
III, 57, 6. váso (íti) râ´sva su-matím visvá-ganyâm.
Grant us, O Vasu, thy favour, which is glorious among men!
VII, 100, 2. tvâm vishno (íti) su-matím visvá-ganyâm—dâh.
Mayest thou, Vishnu, give thy favour, which is glorious among men!
X, 11, 7. yáh te agne su-matím mártah ákshat.
The mortal who obtained thy favour, O Agni.
II, 34, 15. arvâ´kî sâ´ marutah yâ´ vah ûtíh ó (íti) sú vâsrâ´-iva su-matíh gigâtu.
Your help, O Maruts, which is to usward, your favour may it come near, like a cow!
VIII, 22, 4. asmâ´n ákkha su-matíh vâm subhah patî (íti) â dhenúh-iva dhâvatu.
May your favour, O Asvins, hasten towards us, like a cow!
But this meaning is by no means the invariable meaning of sumatí, and it will easily be seen that, in the following
p. 221
passages, the word must be translated by prayer. Thus when Sarasvatî is called (I, 3, 11) kétantî su-matînâ´m, this can only mean she who knows of the prayers, as before she is called kodayitrî´ sûnrítânâm, she who excites songs of praise:
I, 151, 7. ákkha gírah su-matím gantam asma-yû´ (íti).
Come towards the songs, towards the prayer, you who are longing for us. Cf. X, 20, 10.
II, 43, 3. tûshnî´m â´sînah su-matím kikiddhi nah.
Sitting quiet, listen, O Sakuni (bird), to our prayer!
V, 1, 10. â´ bhándishthasya su-matím kikiddhi.
Take notice of the prayer of thy best praiser! Cf. V, 33, I.
VII, 18, 4. â´ nah índrah su-matím gantu ákkha.
May Indra come to our prayer!
VII, 31, 10. prá-ketase prá su-matím krinudhvam.
Make a prayer for the wise god!
IX, 96, 2. su-matím yâti ákkha.
He (Soma) goes near to the prayer.
X, 148, 3. rishînâm víprah su-matím kakânáh.
Thou, the wise, desiring the prayer of the Rishis.
VIII, 22, 6. tâ´ vâm adyá sumatí-bhih subhah patî (íti) ásvinâ prá stuvîmahi.
Let us praise to-day the glorious Asvins with our prayers.
IX, 74, 1. tám îmahe su-matî´.
We implore him with prayer.
In our passage the verb pipartana, fill or fulfil, indicates in what sense sumatí ought to be taken. Su-matím pipartana is no more than kâ´mam pipartana, fulfil our desire! See VII, 62, 3. â´ nah kâ´mam pûpurantu; I, 158, 2. kâmapréna-iva mánasâ. On sumná, see Burnouf, Études, p. 91, and Aufrecht, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. iv, p. 274.
Note 3. Krívih-datî has been a crux to ancient and modern interpreters. It is mentioned as a difficult word in the Nighantu, and all that Yâska has to say is that it means possessed of cutting teeth (Nir. VI, 30. krivirdatî vikartanadantî). Professor Roth, in his note to this passage, says that krivi can never have the meaning of well, which is ascribed to it in the Nighantu III, 23, but seems rather to mean an animal, perhaps the wild boar, κάπρος, with metathesis of v and r. He translates our passage: 'Where
p. 222
your lightning with boar-teeth tears.' In his Dictionary, however, he only says, 'krivis, perhaps the name of an animal, and dant, tooth.' Sâyana contents himself with explaining krívirdatî by vikshepanasîladantî, having teeth that scatter about.
My own translation is founded on the supposition that krívis, the first portion of krívirdatî, has nothing to do with krivi, but is a dialectic variety of kravís, raw flesh, the Greek κρέας, Latin caro, cruor. It means what is raw, bloody, or gory. From it the adjective krûra, horrible, cruentus (Curtius, Grundzüge, p. 142; Kuhn, Zeitschrift, vol. ii, p. 235). A name of the goddess Durgâ in later Sanskrit is krûradantî, and with a similar conception the lightning, I believe, is here called krívirdatî, with gory teeth.
Note 4. It should be observed that in rádati the simile of the teeth of the lightning is carried on. For rádati may be supposed to have had in the Veda, too, the original meaning of râdere and rôdere, to scratch, to gnaw. Rada and radana in the later Sanskrit mean tooth. It is curious, however, that there is no other passage in the Rig-veda where rad clearly means to bite. It means to cut, in
I, 61, 12. góh ná párva ví rada tiraskâ´.
Cut his joint through, as the joint of an ox.
But in most passages where rad occurs in the Veda, it has the meaning of giving. It is not the same which we have in the Zend râd, to give, and which Justi rightly identifies with the root râdh. But rad, to divide, may, like the German theilen in zutheilen, have taken the meaning of giving. Greek δαίω means to divide, but yields δαίς, portion, meal, just as Sanskrit day, to divide, yields dâyas, share, i. e. inheritance.
This meaning is evident in the following passages:
VII, 79, 4. tâ´vat ushah râ´dhah asmábhyam râsva yâ´vat stotrí-bhyah áradah grinânâ´.
Grant us, Ushas, so much wealth as thou hast given to the singers, when praised.
I, 116, 7. kakshî´vate aradatam púram-dhim.
You gave wisdom to Kakshîvat.
I, 169, 8. ráda marút-bhih surúdhah gó-agrâh.
p. 223
Give to the Maruts gifts, rich in cattle.
VII, 62, 3. ví nah sahásram surúdhah radantu.
May they (the gods) give to us a thousand gifts!
I, 117, 11. vâ´gam víprâya—rádantâ.
Giving spoil to the sage!
VI, 61, 6. ráda pûshâ´-iva nah saním.
Give us, Sarasvatî, wealth, like Pûshan!
IX, 93, 4. rada índo (íti) rayím.
Give us, O Indra, wealth!
VII, 32, 18. rada-vaso (íti).
Indra, thou who givest wealth!
In many passages, however, this verb rad is connected with words meaning way or path, and it then becomes a question whether it simply means to grant a way, or to cut a way open for some one. In Zend, too, the same idiom occurs, and Professor Justi explains it by 'prepare a way.' I subjoin the principal passages:
VI, 30, 3. yát âbhyah áradah gâtúm indra.
That thou hast cut a way for them (the rivers). Cf. VII, 74, 4.
IV, 19, 2. prá vartanî´h aradah visvá-dhenâh.
Thou (Indra) hast cut open the paths for all the cows.
X, 75, 2. prá te aradat várunah yâ´tave patháh.
Varuna cut the paths for thee to go.
VII, 87, 1. rádat patháh várunah sû´ryâya.
Varuna cut paths for Sûrya.
V, 80, 3. patháh rádantî suvitâ´ya devî´.
She, the dawn, cutting open the paths for welfare.
VII, 60, 4. yásmai âdityâ´h ádhvanah rádanti.
For whom the Âdityas cut roads.
II, 30, 2. patháh rádantîh—dhûnayah yanti ártham.
Cutting their paths, the rivers go to their goal.
This last verse seems to show that the cutting open of a road is really the idea expressed by rad in all these passages. And thus we find the rivers themselves saying that Indra cut them out or delivered them:
III, 33, 6. índrah asmâ´n aradat vágra-bâhuh. Cf. X, 89, 7.
Note 5. Rinâ´ti, like the preceding expressions krívirdatî and rádati, is not chosen at random, for though it has the
p. 224
general meaning of crushing or destroying, it is used by the Vedic poets with special reference to the chewing or crunching by means of the teeth. For instance,
I, 148, 4. purû´ni dasmáh ní rinâti gámbhaih.
Agni crunches many things with his jaws.
I, 127, 4. sthirâ´ kit ánnâ ní rinâti ógasâ.
Even tough morsels he (Agni) crunches fiercely. In a more general sense we find it used,
V, 41, 10. sokíh-kesah ní rinâti vánâ.
Agni with flaming hair swallows or destroys the forests.
IV, 19, 3. áhim vágrena ví rinâh.
Thou destroyedst Ahi with the thunderbolt.
X, 120, 1. sadyáh gagñânáh ní rinâti sátrûn.
As soon as born he destroys his enemies.
Note 6. Súdhitâ-iva barhánâ. I think the explanation of this phrase given by Sâyana may be retained. He explains súdhitâ by suhitâ, i. e. sushthu preritâ, well thrown, well levelled, and barhánâ by hatis, tatsâdhanâ hetir vâ, a blow or its instrument, a weapon. Professor Roth takes barhánâ as an instrumental, used adverbially, in the sense of powerfully, but he does not explain in what sense súdhitâ-iva ought then to be taken. We cannot well refer it to didyút, lightning, on account of the iva, which requires something that can form a simile of the lightning. Nor is su-dhitâ ever used as a substantive so as to take the place of svádhitîva. Sú-dhita has apparently many meanings, but they all centre in one common conception. Sú-dhita means well placed, of a thing which is at rest, well arranged, well ordered, secure; or it means well sent, well thrown, of a thing which has been in motion. Applied to human beings, it means well disposed or kind.
III, 23, 1. níh-mathitah sú-dhitah â´ sadhá-sthe.
Agni produced by rubbing, and well placed in his abode.
VII, 42, 4. sú-prîtah agníh sú-dhitah dáme â´.
Agni, who is cherished and well placed in the house.
III, 29, 2. arányoh ní-hitah gâtá-vedâh gárbhah-iva sú-dhitah garbhínîshu.
Agni placed in the two fire-sticks, well placed like an embryo in the mothers. Cf. X, 27, 16.
p. 225
VIII, 60, 4. abhí práyâmsi sú-dhitâ â´ vaso (íti) gahi.
Come, O Vasu, to these well-placed offerings. Cf. I, 135, 4; VI, 15, 15; X, 53, 2.
X, 70, 8. sû-dhitâ havî´mshi.
The well-placed offerings.
IV, 2, 10 (adhvarám). VII, 7, 3 (barhíh).
As applied to â´yus, life, súdhita may be translated by well established, safe:
II, 27, 10. asyâ´ma â´yûmshi sú-dhitâni pû´rvâ.
May we obtain the happy long lives of our forefathers.
IV, 50, 8. sáh ít ksheti sú-dhitah ókasi své.
That man dwells secure in his own house.
Applied to a missile weapon, súdhita may mean well placed, as it were, well shouldered, well held, before it is thrown; or well levelled, well aimed, when it is thrown:
I, 167, 3. mimyáksha yéshu sú-dhitâ—rishtíh.
To whom the well held spear sticks fast.
VI, 33, 3. tvám tâ´n indra ubháyân amítrân dâ´sâ vritrâ´ni â´ryâ ka sûra, vádhîh vánâ-iva sú-dhitebhih átkaih.
Thou, Indra, O hero, struckest both enemies, the barbarous and the Aryan fiends, like forests with well-aimed weapons.
Applied to a poem, súdhita means well arranged or perfect:
I, 140, 11. idám agne sú-dhitam dúh-dhitât ádhi priyâ´t ûm (íti) kit mánmanah préyah astu te.
May this perfect prayer be more agreeable to thee than an imperfect one, though thou likest it.
VII, 32, 13. mántram ákharvam sú-dhitam. A poem, not mean, well contrived.
As applied to men, súdhita means very much the same as hitá, well disposed, kind:
IV, 6, 7. ádha mitráh ná sú-dhitah pâvakáh agníh dîdâya mâ´nushîshu vikshú.
Then, like a kind friend, Agni shone among the children of man.
V, 3, 2. mitrám sú-dhitam.
VI, 15, 2. mitrám ná yám sú-dhitam.
VIII, 23, 8. mitrám ná gáne sú-dhitam ritá-vani.
p. 226
X, 115, 7. mitrâ´sah ná yé sú-dhitâh.
At last sú-dhita, without reference to human beings, takes the general sense of kind, good:
III, 11, 8. pári vísvâni sú-dhitâ agnéh asyâma mánma-bhih.
May we obtain through our prayers all the goods of Agni.
Here, however, práyâmsi may have to be supplied, and in that case this passage, too, should be classed with those mentioned above, VIII, 60, 4, &c.
If then we consider that súdhita, as applied to weapons, means well held or well aimed, we can hardly doubt that barhánâ is here, as Sâyana says, some kind of weapon. I should derive it from barhayati, to crush, which we have, for instance,
I, 133, 5. pisáṅga-bhrishtim ambhrinám pisâ´kim indra sám mrina, sárvam rákshah ní barhaya.
Pound together the fearful Pisâki with his fiery weapons, strike down every Rakshas.
II, 23, 8. bríhaspate deva-nídah ní barhaya.
Brihaspati strike down the scoffers of the gods. Cf. VI, 61, 3.
Barhánâ would therefore mean a weapon intended to crush an enemy, a block of stone, it may be, or a heavy club, and in that sense barhánâ occurs at least once more:
VIII, 63, 7. yát pâ´ñka-ganyayâ visâ´ índre ghóshâh ásrikshata, ástrinât barhánâ vipáh.
When shouts have been sent up to Indra by the people of the five clans, then the club scattered the spears; or, then he scattered the spears with his club.
In other passages Professor Roth is no doubt right when he assigns to barhánâ an adverbial meaning, but I do not think that this meaning would be appropriate in our verse. Grassmann also translates, 'ein wohlgezielter Pfeil.'
Verse 7.
Note 1. Alâtrinâ´sah, a word which occurs but once more, and which had evidently become unintelligible even at the
p. 227
time of Yâska. He (Nir. VI, 2) explains it by alamâtardano meghah, the cloud which opens easily. This, at least, is the translation given by Professor Roth, though not without hesitation. Alamâtardanah, as a compound, is explained by the commentator as âtardanaparyâptah, alam âtardayitum udakam, i. e. capable of letting off the water. But Devarâgayagvan explains it differently. He says: alam paryâptam âtardanam himsâ yasya, bahûdakatvâkkhabalo megho viseshyate, i. e. whose injuring is great; the dark cloud is so called because it contains much water. Sâyana. too, attempts several explanations. In III, 30, 10, he seems to derive it from trih, to kill, not, like Yâska, from trid, and he explains its meaning as the cloud which is exceedingly hurt by reason of its holding so much water. In our passage he explains it either as anâtrina, free from injury, or good hurters of enemies, or good givers of rewards.
From all this I am afraid we gain nothing. Let us now see what modern commentators have proposed in order to discover an appropriate meaning in this word. Professor Roth suggests that the word may be derived from râ, to give, and the suffix trina, and the negative particle, thus meaning, one who does not give or yield anything. But, if so, how is this adjective applicable to the Maruts, who in this very verse are praised for their generosity? Langlois in our passage translates, 'heureux de nos louanges;' in III, 30, 10, qui laissait flétrir les plantes.' Wilson in our passage translates, 'devoid of malevolence;' but in III, 30, 10, 'heavy.'
I do not pretend to solve all these difficulties, but I may say this in defence of my own explanation that it fulfils the condition of being applicable both to the Maruts and to the demon Bala. The suffix trina is certainly irregular, and I should much prefer to write alâtrina, for in that case we might derive lâtrin from lâtra, and to this lâtra, i. e. râtra, I. should ascribe the sense of barking. The root rai or râ means to bark, and has been connected by Professor Aufrecht with Latin rire, inrire, and possibly inritare a,

p. 228
thus showing a transition of meaning from barking, to provoking or attacking. The same root râ explains also the Latin lâtrare, to bark, allatrare, to assail; and, whatever ancient etymologists may say to the contrary, the Latin latro, an assailer. The old derivation 'latrones eos antiqui dicebant, qui conducti militabant, ἀπὸ τῆς λατρείας,' seems to me one of those etymologies in which the scholars of Rome, who had learnt a little Greek, delighted as much as scholars who know a little Sanskrit delight in finding some plausible derivation for any Greek or Latin word in Sanskrit. I know that Curtius (Grundzüge, p. 326) and Corssen (Kritische Nachträge, p. 239) take a different view; but a foreign word, derived from λάτρον, pay, hire, would never have proved so fertile as latro has been in Latin.
If then we could write alâtrinâ´sah, we should have an appropriate epithet of the Maruts, in the sense of not assailing or not reviling, in fact, free from malevolence, as Wilson translated the word, or rather Sâyana's explanation of it, âtardanarahita. What gives me some confidence in this explanation is this, that it is equally applicable to the other passage where alâtrina occurs, III, 30, 10:
alâtrináh valáh indra vragáh góh purâ´ hántoh bháyamânah ví âra.
Without barking did Vala, the keeper of the cow, full of tear, open, before thou struckest him.
If it should be objected that vragá means always stable, and is not used again in the sense of keeper, one might reply that vragáh, in the nom. sing., occurs in this one single passage only, and that bháyamânah, fearing, clearly implies a personification. Otherwise, one might translate: 'Vala was quiet, O Indra, and the stable of the cow came open, full of fear, before thou struckest.' The meaning of alâtriná would remain the same, the not-barking being here used as a sign that Indra's enemy was cowed, and no longer inclined to revile or defy the power of Indra. Hom. hymn. in Merc. 145, οὐδὲ κύνες λελάκοντο.
Note 2. See I, 38, 15, note 1, page 95.
p. 229
Verse 8.
Note 1. Abhí-hruti seems to have the meaning of assault, injury, insult. It occurs but once, but abhí-hrut, a feminine substantive with the same meaning, occurs several times. The verb hru, which is not mentioned in the Dhâtupâtha, but has been identified with hvar, occurs in our hymn, verse 12:
I, 128, 5. sáh nah trâsate duh-itâ´t abhi-hrútah sámsât aghâ´t abhi-hrútah.
He protects us from evil, from assault, from evil speaking, from assault.
X, 63, 11. trâ´yadhvam nah duh-évâyâh abhi-hrútah.
Protect us from mischievous injury!
I, 189, 6. abhi-hrútâm ási hí deva vishpát.
For thou, god, art the deliverer from all assaults. Vishpát, deliverer, from vi and spas, to bind.
Ví-hruta, which occurs twice, means evidently what has been injured or spoiled:
VIII, 1, 12. íshkartâ ví-hrutam púnar (iti).
He who sets right what has been injured. Cf. VIII, 20, 26.
Ávi-hruta again clearly means uninjured, intact, entire:
V, 66, 2. tâ´ hí kshatrám ávi-hrutam—â´sâte.
For they both have obtained uninjured power.
X, 170, 1. â´yuh dádhat yagñá-patau ávi-hrutam.
Giving uninjured life to the lord of the sacrifice.
Verse 9.
Note 1. Tavishá certainly means strength, and that it is used in the plural in the sense of acts of strength, we can see from the first verse of our hymn and other passages. But when we read that tavishâ´ni are placed on the chariots of the Maruts, just as before bhadrâ´, good things, food, &c., are mentioned, it is clear that so abstract a meaning as strength or powers would not be applicable here. We might take it in the modern sense of forces, i. e. your armies, your companions are on your chariots, striving with each other; but as the word is a neuter, weapons, as the means
p. 230
of strength, seemed a preferable rendering. As to mithaspridhya, see I, 119, 3, p. 164.
Note 2. The rendering of this passage must depend on the question whether the khâdís, whatever they are, can be carried on the shoulders or not. We saw before (p. 120) that khâdís were used both as ornaments and as weapons, and that, when used as weapons, they were most likely rings or quoits with sharp edges. There is at least one other passage where these khâdís are said to be worn on the shoulders:
VII, 56, 13. ámseshu â´ marutah khâdáyah vah vákshah-su rukmâ´h upa-sisriyânâ´h.
On your shoulders are the quoits, on your chests the golden chains are fastened.
In other places the khâdís are said to be in the hands, hásteshu, but this would only show that they are there when actually used for fighting. Thus we read:
I, 168, 3. â´ eshâm ámseshu rambhínî-iva rarabhe, hásteshu khâdíh ka kritíh ka sám dadhe.
To their shoulders there clings as if a clinging wife, in their hands the quoit is held and the dagger.
In V, 58, 2, the Maruts are called khâ´di-hasta, holding the quoits in their hands. There is one passage which was mentioned before (p. 112), where the khâdís are said to be on the feet of the Maruts, and on the strength of this passage Professor Roth proposes to alter prá-patheshu to prá-padeshu, and to translate, 'The khâdís are on your forefeet.' I do not think this emendation necessary. Though we do not know the exact shape and character of the khâdí, we know that it was a weapon, most likely a ring, occasionally used for ornament, and carried along either on the feet or on the shoulders, but in actual battle held in the hand. The weapon which Vishnu holds in one of his right hands, the so-called kakra, may be the modern representation of the ancient khâdí. What, however, is quite certain is this, that khâdí in the Veda never means food, as Sâyana optionally interprets it. This interpretation is accepted by Wilson, who translates, 'At your resting-places on the road refreshments (are ready).' Nay, he
p. 231
goes on in a note to use this passage as a proof of the advanced civilisation of India at the time of the Vedic Rishis. 'The expression,' he says, 'is worthy of note, as indicating the existence of accommodations for the use of travellers: the prapatha is the choltri of the south of India, the sarái of the Mohammedans, a place by the road-side where the travellers may find shelter and provisions.'
Note 3. This last passage shows that the poet is really representing to himself the Maruts as on their journey, and he therefore adds, 'your axle turns the two (IV, 30, 2) wheels together,' which probably means no more than, 'your chariot is going smoothly or quickly.' Though the expression seems to us hardly correct, yet one can well imagine how the axle was supposed to turn the wheels as the horses were drawing the axle, and the axle acted on the wheels. Anyhow, no other translation seems possible. Samáyâ in the Veda means together, at once, and is the Greek (ὁμῇ, generally ὁμοῦ or ὁμῶς, the Latin simul. Cf. I, 56, 6; 73, 6; 113, 10; 163, 3; VII, 66, 15; IX, 75, 4; 85, 5; 97, 56.
Vrit means to turn, and is frequently used with reference to the wheels:
VIII, 46, 23. dása syâvâ´h—nemím ní vavrituh.
The ten black horses turn down the felly or the wheel.
IV, 30, 2. satrâ´ te ánu krishtáyah vísvâh kakrâ´-iva vavrituh.
All men turn always round thee, like wheels.
That the Âtmanepada of vrit may be used in an active sense we see from
I, 191, 15. tátah vishám prá vavrite.
I turn the poison out from here.
All the words used in this sentence are very old words, and we can with few exceptions turn them into Greek or Latin. In Latin we should have axis vos(ter) circos simul divertit. In Greek ἄξων ὑ(μῶν) κύκλω ὁμῇ …

Note 3. On éta in the sense of fallow deer, or, it may be, antelope, see I, 165, 5, note 2, page 196.
Éta originally means variegated, and thus becomes a name of any speckled deer, it being difficult to say what exact species is meant. Sâyana in our passage explains étâh by suklavarnâ mâlâh, many-coloured wreaths or chains, which may be right. Yet the suggestion of Professor Roth that étâh, deer, stands here for the skins of fallow deer, is certainly more poetical, and quite in accordance with the Vedic idiom, which uses, for instance, go, cow, not only in the sense of milk,—that is done even in more homely English,—but also for leather, and thong. It is likewise in accordance with what we know of the earliest dress of the Vedic Indians, that deer-skins should here be mentioned. We learn from Âsvalâyana's Grihya-sûtras, of which we now possess an excellent edition by Professor Stenzler, and a reprint of the text and commentary by Râma Nârâyana Vidyâratna, in the Bibliotheca Indica, that a boy when he was brought to his tutor, i. e. from the eighth to possibly the twenty-fourth year, had to be well combed, and attired in a new dress. A Brâhmana should wear the skin of an antelope (aineya), the Kshatriya the skin of a deer (raurava), the Vaisya the skin of a goat (âga). If they wore dresses, that of the Brâhmana should be dark red (kâshâya), that of the Kshatriya bright red (mâñgishtha), that of the Vaisya yellow (hâridra). The girdle of the Brâhmana should be of Muñga grass, that of the Kshatriya a bow-string, that of the Vaisya made of sheep's wool. The same regulations occur in other Sûtras, as, for instance, the Dharma-sûtras of the Âpastambîyas and Gautamas, though there are certain characteristic differences in each, which may be due either to local or to chronological causes. Thus according to the Âpastambîya-sûtras, which have been published by Professor Bühler, the Brâhmana may wear the skin of the harina deer, or that of the antelope (aineyam), but the latter must be from the black antelope (krishnam), and, a proviso is added, that if a man wears the black antelope skin, he must never spread it out to sit or sleep on it. As materials for the dress, Âpastamba
p. 233
allows sana, hemp a, or kshumâ, flax, and he adds that woollen dresses are allowed to all castes, as well as the kambala (masc.), which seems to be any cloth made of vegetable substances (darbhâdinirmitam kîram kambalam). He then adds a curious remark, which would seem to show

p. 234
that the Brâhmanas preferred skins, and the Kshatriyas clothes, for he says that those who wish well to the Brâhmanas should wear agina, skins, and those who wish well to the Kshatriyas should wear vastra, clothes, and those who wish well to both should wear both, but, in that case, the skin should always form the outer garment. The Dharma-sûtras of the Gautamas, which were published in India, prescribe likewise for the Brâhmana the black antelope skin, and allow clothes of hemp or linen (sânakshaumakîra) as well as kutapas (woollen cloth) for all. What is new among the Gautamas is, that they add the kârpâsa, the cotton dress, which is important as showing an early knowledge of this manufacture. The kârpâsa dress occurs once more as a present to be given to the Potar priest (Âsv. Srauta-sûtras IX, 4), and was evidently considered as a valuable present, taking precedence of the kshaumî or linen dress. It is provided that the cotton dress should not be dyed, for this, I suppose, is the meaning of avikrita. Immediately after, however, it is said, that some authorities say the dress should be dyed red (kâshâyam apy eke), the very expression which occurred in Âpastamba, and that, in that case, the red for the Brâhmana's dress should be taken from the bark of trees (vârksha). Manu, who here, as elsewhere, simply paraphrases the ancient Sûtras, says, II, 41:


'Let Brahmakârins wear (as outer garments) the skins of the black antelope, the deer, the goat, (as under garments) dresses of hemp, flax, and sheep's wool, in the order of the three castes.'
The Sanskrit name for a dressed skin is agina, a word which does not occur in the Rig-Veda, but which, if Bopp is right in deriving it from agá, goat, as αἰγίς from αἴξ, would have meant originally, not skin in general, but a goat-skin. The skins of the éta, here ascribed to the Maruts, would be identical with the aineya, which Âsvalâyana ascribes to the Brâhmana, not, as we should expect, to the Kshatriya, if, as has been supposed, aineya is derived from ena, which is a secondary form, particularly in the
p. 235
feminine enî, of eta. There is, however, another word, eda, a kind of sheep, which, but for Festus, might be haedus, and by its side ena, a kind of antelope. These two forms pre-suppose an earlier erna or arna, and point therefore in a different direction, though hardly to ἄρνες.
Note 4. I translate kshurá by sharp edges, but it might have been translated literally by razors, for, strange as it may sound, razors were known, not only during the Vedic period, but even previous to the Aryan separation. The Sanskrit kshurá is the Greek ξυρός or ξυρόν. In the Veda we have clear allusions to shaving:
X, 142, 4. yadâ´ te vâ´tah anu-vâ´ti sokíh, váptâ-iva smásru vapasi prá bhû´ma.
When the wind blows after thy blast, then thou shavest the earth as a barber shaves the beard. Cf. I, 65, 4.
If, as B. and R. suggest, vaptar, barber, is connected with the more modern name for barber in Sanskrit, viz. nâpita. we should have to admit a root svap, in the sense of tearing or pulling, vellere, from which we might derive the Vedic svapû´ (VII, 56, 3), beak. Corresponding to this we find in Old High-German snabul, beak, (schnepfe, snipe,) and in Old Norse nef. The Anglo-Saxon neb means mouth and nose, while in modern English neb or nib is used for the bill or beak of a bird a. Another derivation of nâpita, proposed by Professor Weber (Kuhn's Beiträge, vol. i, p. 505), who takes nâpita as a dialectic form of snâpitar, balneator, or lavator, might be admitted if it could be proved that in India also the barber was at the same time a balneator. Burnouf, Lotus, p. 452, translating from the Sâmañña-phala Sutta, mentions among the different professions of the people those of 'portier,' 'barbier,' and 'baigneur.'
Verse 11.
Note 1. Ví-bhûtayah is properly a substantive, meaning

p. 236
power, but, like other substantives a, and particularly substantives with prepositions, it can be used as an adjective, and is, in fact, more frequently used as an adjective than as a substantive. In English we may translate it by power. It is a substantive,
I, 8, 9. evá hí te ví-bhûtayah ûtáyah indra mâ´-vate sadyáh kit sánti dâsúshe.
For indeed thy powers, O Indra, are at once shelters for a sacrificer, like me.
But it is an adjective,
I, 30, 5. ví-bhûtih astu sûnrítâ.
May the prayer be powerful.
VI, 17, 4. mahâ´m ánûnam tavásam ví-bhûtim matsarâ´sah garhrishanta pra-sáham.
The sweet draughts of Soma delighted the great, the perfect, the strong, the powerful, the unyielding Indra. Cf. VIII, 49, 6; 50, 6.
Vibhvãh, with the Svarita on the last syllable, has to be pronounced vibhúàh. In III, 6, 9, we find vi-bhávah.

Verse 12.
Note 1. Mahi-tvanám, greatness, is formed by the suffix tvaná, which Professor Aufrecht has identified with the Greek σύνη (συνον); see Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. i, p. 482. The origin of this suffix has been explained by Professor Benfey, ibid. vol. vii, p. 120, who traces it back to the suffix tvan, for instance, i-tvan, goer, in prâtah-ítvâ = prâtah-yâ´vâ.
Note 2. Vratá is one of the many words which, though we may perceive their one central idea, and their original purport, we have to translate by various terms in order to make them intelligible in every passage where they occur. Vratá (from vri, vrinoti), I believe, meant originally what is enclosed, protected, set apart, the Greek νομός:
1. V, 46, 7. yâ´h pâ´rthivâsah yâ´h apâ´m ápi vraté tâ´h nah devîh su-havâh sárma yakkhata.

p. 237
O ye gracious goddesses, who are on the earth or in the realm of the waters, grant us your protection!
Here vratá is used like vrigána, see I, 165, 15, note 3, page 208.
X, 114, 2. tâ´sâm ní kikyuh kaváyah ni-dâ´nam páreshu yâ´h gúhyeshu vratéshu.
The poets discovered their (the Nirritis’) origin, who are in the far hidden chambers.
I, 163, 3. ási tritáh gúhyena vraténa.
Thou art Trita within the hidden place, or with the secret work.
Dr. Muir sent me another passage:
III, 54, 5. dádrisre eshâm avamâ´ sádâmsi páreshu yâ´ gúhyeshu vratéshu.
2. Vratá means what is fenced off or forbidden, what is determined, what is settled, and hence, like dhárman, law, ordinance. Vârayati means to prohibit. In this sense vratá occurs very frequently:
I, 25, 1. yát kit hí te vísah yathâ prá deva varuna vratám, minîmási dyávi-dyavi.
Whatever law of thine we break, O Varuna, day by day, men as we are.
II, 8, 3. yásya vratám ni mî´yate.
Whose law is not broken.
III, 32, 8. índrasya kárma sú-kritâ purû´ni vratâ´ni devâ´h ná minanti vísve.
The deeds of Indra are well done and many, all the gods do not break his laws, or do not injure his ordinances.
II, 24, 12. vísvam satyám maghavânâ yuvóh ít â´pah kaná prá minanti vratám vâm.
All that is yours, O powerful gods, is true; even the waters do not break your law.
II, 38, 7. nákih asya tâ´ni vratâ´ devásya savitúh minanti.
No one breaks these laws of this god Savitar. Cf. II, 38, 9.
I, 92, 12. áminatî daívyâni vratâ´ni.
Not injuring the divine ordinances. Cf. I, 124, 2.
X, 12, 5. kát asya áti vratám kakrima.
Which of his laws have we overstepped?
p. 238
VIII, 25, 16. tásya vratâ´ni ánu vah karâmasi.
His ordinances we follow.
X, 33, 9. ná devâ´nâm áti vratám sati-âtmâ kaná gîvati.
No one lives beyond the statute of the gods, even if he had a hundred lives.
VII, 5, 4. táva tri-dhâ´tu prithivî´ utá dyaúh vaísvânara vratám agne sakanta.
The earth and the sky followed thy threefold law, O Agni Vaisvânara.
VII, 87, 7. yáh mriláyâti kakrúshe kit â´gah vayám syâma várune ánâgâh, ánu vratâ´ni áditeh ridhántah.
Let us be sinless before Varuna, who is gracious even to him who has committed sin, performing the laws of Aditi!
II, 28, 8. námah purâ´ te varuna utá nûnám utá aparám tuvi-gâta bravâma, tvé hí kam párvate ná sritâ´ni áprakyutâni duh-dabha vratâ´ni.
Formerly, and now, and also in future let us give praise to thee, O Varuna; for in thee, O unconquerable, all laws are grounded, immovable as on a rock.
A very frequent expression is ánu vratám, according to the command of a god, II, 38, 3; 6; VIII, 40, 8; or simply ánu vratám, according to law and order:
I, 136, 5. tám aryamâ´ abhí rakshati rigu-yántam ánu vratám.
Aryaman protects him who acts uprightly according to law.
Cf. III, 61, 1; IV, 13, 2; V, 69, 1.
3. The laws or ordinances or institutions of the gods are sometimes taken for the sacrifices which are supposed to be enjoined by the gods, and the performance of which is, in a certain sense, the performance of the divine will.
I, 93, 8. yáh agnî´shómâ havíshâ saparyâ´t devadrî´kâ mánasâ yáh ghriténa, tásya vratám rakshatam pâtám ámhasah.
He who worships Agni and Soma with oblations, with a godly mind, or with an offering, protect his sacrifice, shield him from evil!
I, 31, 2. tvám agne prathamáh áṅgirah-tamah kavíh devâ´nâm pári bhûshasi vratám.
p. 239
Agni, the first and wisest of poets, thou performest the sacrifice of the gods.
III, 3, 9. tásya vratâ´ni bhûri-poshínah vayám úpa bhûshema dáme â´ suvriktí-bhih.
Let us, who possess much wealth, perform with prayers the sacrifices of Agni within our house.
In another acceptation the vratas of the gods are what they perform and establish themselves, their own deeds:
III, 6, 5. vratâ´ te agne mahatáh mahâ´ni táva krátvâ ródasî (íti) â´ tatantha.
The deeds of thee, the great Agni, are great, by thy power thou hast stretched out heaven and earth.
VIII, 42, 1. ástabhnât dyâ´m ásurah visvá-vedâh ámimîta varimâ´nam prithivyâ´h, a asîdat vísvâ bhúvanâni sam-râ´t vísvâ ít tâ´ni várunasya vratâ´ni.
The wise spirit established the sky, and made the width of the earth, as king he approached all beings,—all these are the works of Varuna.
VI, 14, 3. tû´rvantah dásyum âyávah vrataíh sî´kshantah avratám.
Men fight the fiend, trying to overcome by their deeds him who performs no sacrifices; or, the lawless enemy.
Lastly, vratá comes to mean sway, power, or work, and the expression vraté táva signifies, at thy command, under thy auspices:
I, 24, 15. átha vayám âditya vraté táva ánâgasah áditaye syâma.
Then, O Âditya, under thy auspices may we be guiltless before Aditi.
VI, 54, 9. pû´shan táva vraté vayám ni rishyema kádâ kaná.
O Pûshan, may we never fail under thy protection.
X, 36, 13. ye savitûh satyá-savasya vísve mitrásya vraté várunasya devâ´h.
All the gods who are in the power of Savitar, Mitra, and Varuna.
V, 83, 5. yásya vraté prithivî´ námnamîti yásya vraté saphá-vat gárbhurîti, yásya vraté óshadhîh visvá-rûpâh sáh nah parganya máhi sárma yakkha.
p. 240
At whose bidding the earth bows down, at whose bidding hoofed animals run about, at whose bidding the plants assume all shapes, mayest thou, O Parganya, yield us great protection!
Note 3. Dâtrá, if derived from dâ, would mean gift, and that meaning is certainly the most applicable in some passages where it occurs:
IX, 97, 55. ási bhágah ási dâtrásya dâtâ´.
Thou art Bhaga, thou art the giver of the gift.
In other passages, too, particularly in those where the verb dâ or some similar verb occurs in the same verse, it can hardly be doubted that the poet took dâtrá, like dátra or dáttra, in the sense of gift, bounty, largess:
I, 116, 6. yám asvinâ dadáthuh svetám ásvam—tát vâm dâtrám máhi kîrtényam bhût.
The white horse, O Asvins, which you gave, that your gift was great and to be praised.
I, 185, 3. aneháh dâtrám áditeh anarvám huvé.
I call for the unrivalled, the uninjured bounty of Aditi.
VII, 56, 21. mâ´ vah dâtrâ´t marutah níh arâma.
May we not fall away from your bounty, O Maruts!
III, 54, 16. yuvám hí stháh rayi-daú nah rayînâ´m dâtrám rakshethe.
For you, Nâsatyas, are our givers of riches, you protect the gift.
VI, 20, 7. rigísvane dâtrám dâsúshe dâh.
To Rigisvan, the giver, thou givest the gift.
VIII, 43, 33. tát te sahasva îmahe dâtrám yát ná upadásyati, tvát agne vâ´ryam vásu.
We ask thee, strong hero, for the gift which does not perish; we ask from thee the precious wealth.
X, 69, 4. dâtrám rakshasva yát idám te asmé (íti).
Protect this gift of thine which thou hast given to us.
VIII, 44, 18. î´sishe vâ´ryasya hí dâtrásya agne svãh-patih.
For thou, O Agni, lord of heaven, art the master of the precious gift. Cf. IV, 38, 1.
Professor Roth considers that dâtrá is derived rather from dâ, to divide, and that it means share, lot, possession. But there is not a single passage where the meaning of gift or
p. 241
bounty does not answer all purposes. In VII, 56, 21, mâ´ vah dâtrâ´t marutah níh arâma, is surely best translated by, 'let us not fall away from your bounty,' and in our own passage the same meaning should be assigned to dâtrá. The idea of dâtrá, bounty, is by no means incompatible with vratá, realm, dominion, sway, if we consider that the sphere within which the bounty of a king or a god is exercised and accepted, is in one sense his realm. What the poet therefore says in our passage is simply this, that the bounty of the Maruts extends as far as the realm of Aditi, i. e. is endless, or extends everywhere, Aditi being in its original conception the deity of the unbounded world beyond, the earliest attempt at expressing the Infinite.
As to dâ´tra occurring once with the accent on the first syllable in the sense of sickle, see M. M., 'Über eine Stelle in Yâska's Commentar zum Naighantuka,' Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 1853, vol. vii, P. 375.
VIII, 78, 10. táva ít indra ahám â-sásâ háste dâ´tram kaná â´ dade.
Trusting in thee alone, O Indra, I take the sickle in my hand.
This dâ´tra, sickle, is derived from do, to cut.
Aditi, the Infinite.
Note 4. Aditi, an ancient god or goddess, is in reality the earliest name invented to express the Infinite; not the Infinite as the result of a long process of abstract reasoning, but the visible Infinite, visible, as it were, to the naked eye, the endless expanse beyond the earth, beyond the clouds, beyond the sky. That was called A-diti, the un-bound, the un-bounded; one might almost say, but for fear of misunderstandings, the Absolute, for it is derived from diti, bond, and the negative particle, and meant therefore originally what is free from bonds of any kind, whether of space or time, free from physical weakness, free from moral guilt. Such a conception became of necessity a being, a person, a god. To us such a name and such a conception seem decidedly modern, and to find in the Veda Aditi, the
p. 242
[paragraph continues]
Infinite, as the mother of the principal gods, is certainly, at first sight, startling. But the fact is that the thoughts of primitive humanity were not only different from our thoughts, but different also from what we think their thoughts ought to have been. The poets of the Veda indulged freely in theogonic speculations, without being frightened by any contradictions. They knew of Indra as the greatest of gods, they knew of Agni as the god of gods, they knew of Varuna as the ruler of all, but they were by no means startled at the idea that their Indra had a mother, or that their Agni was born like a babe from the friction of two fire-sticks, or that Varuna and his brother Mitra were nursed in the lap of Aditi. Some poet would take hold o the idea of an unbounded power, of Aditi, originally without any reference to other gods. Very soon these ideas met, and, without any misgivings, either the gods were made subordinate to, and represented as the sons of Aditi, or where Indra was to be praised as supreme, Aditi was represented as doing him homage.
VIII, 12, 14. utá sva-râge áditih stómam índrâya gîganat.
And Aditi produced a hymn for Indra, the king.
Here Professor Roth takes Aditi as an epithet of Agni, not as the name of the goddess Aditi, while Dr. Muir rightly takes it in the latter sense, and likewise retains stómam instead of sómam, as printed by Professor Aufrecht. Cf. VII, 38, 4.
The idea of the Infinite, as I have tried to show elsewhere, was most powerfully impressed on the awakening mind, or, as we now say, was revealed, by the East a. ‘It is impossible to enter fully into all the thoughts and feelings that passed through the minds of the early poets when they formed names for that far, far East from whence even the early dawn, the sun, the day, their own life, seemed to spring. A new life flashed up every morning before their eyes, and the fresh breezes of the dawn reached them like greetings from the distant lands beyond the mountains, beyond the clouds, beyond the dawn, beyond “the immortal

p. 243
sea which brought us hither.” The dawn seemed to them to open golden gates for the sun to pass in triumph, and while those gates were open, their eyes and their mind strove in their childish way to pierce beyond the limits of this finite world. That silent aspect awakened in the human mind the conception of the Infinite, the Immortal, the Divine.’ Aditi is a name for that distant East, but Aditi is more than the dawn. Aditi is beyond the dawn, and in one place (I, 113, 19) the dawn is called 'the face of Aditi,' áditer ánîkam. Thus we read:
V, 62, 8. híranya-rûpam ushásah ví-ushtau áyah-sthûnam út-itâ sû´ryasya, â´ rohathah varuna mitra gártam átah kakshâthe (íti) áditim dítim h.
Mitra and Varuna, you mount your chariot, which is golden, when the dawn bursts forth, and has iron poles at the setting of the sun: from thence you see Aditi and Diti, i. e. what is yonder and what is here.
If we keep this original conception of Aditi clearly before our mind, the various forms which Aditi assumes, even in the hymns of the Veda, will not seem incoherent. Aditi is not a prominent deity in the Veda, she is celebrated rather in her sons, the Âdityas, than in her own person. While there are so many hymns addressed to Ushas, the dawn, or Indra, or Agni, or Savitar, there is but one hymn, X, 72, which from our point of view, though not from that of Indian theologians, might be called a hymn to Aditi. Nevertheless Aditi is a familiar name; a name of the past, whether in time or in thought only, and a name that lives on in the name of the Âdityas, the sons of Aditi, including the principal deities of the Veda.
Aditi and the Âdityas.
Thus we read:
I, 107, 2. ûpa nah devâ´h ávasâ â´ gamantu áṅgirasâm sâ´ma-bhih stûyámânâh, índrah indriyaíh marûtah marút-bhih âdityaíh nah áditih sárma yamsat.
May the gods come to us with their help, praised by the songs of the Aṅgiras,—Indra with his powers, the Maruts with the storms, may Aditi with the Âdityas give us protection!
p. 244
X, 66, 3. índrah vásu-bhih pári pâtu nah gáyam âdityaíh nah áditih sárma yakkhatu, rudráh rudrébhih deváh mrilayâti nah tváshtâ nah gnâ´bhih suvitâ´ya ginvatu.
May Indra with the Vasus watch our house, may Aditi with the Âdityas give us protection, may the divine Rudra with the Rudras have mercy upon us, may Tvashtar with the mothers bring us to happiness!
III, 54, 20. âdityaíh nah áditih srinotu yákkhantu nah marûtah sárma bhadrám.
May Aditi with the Âdityas hear us, may the Maruts give us good protection!
In another passage Varuna takes the place of Aditi as the leader of the Âdityas:
VII, 35, 6. sám nah índrah vásu-bhih deváh astu sám âdityébhih várunah su-sámsah, sám nah rudráh rudrébhih gálâshah sám nah tváshtâ gnâ´bhih ihá srinotu.
May Indra bless us, the god with the Vasus! May Varuna, the glorious, bless us with the Âdityas! May the relieving Rudra with the Rudras bless us! May Tvashtar with the mothers kindly hear us here!
Even in passages where the poet seems to profess an exclusive worship of Aditi, as in
V, 69, 3. prâtáh devî´m áditim gohavîmi madhyándine út-itâ sû´ryasya,
I invoke the divine Aditi early in the morning, at noon, and at the setting of the sun,
Mitra and Varuna, her principal sons, are mentioned immediately after, and implored, like her, to bestow blessings on their worshipper.
Her exclusive worship appears once, in VIII, 19, 14.
A very frequent expression is that of âdityâ´h áditih without any copula, to signify the Âdityas and Aditi:
IV, 25, 3. káh devâ´nâm ávah adyá vrinîte káh âdityâ´n áditim gyótih îtte.
Who does choose now the protection of the gods? Who asks the Âdityas, Aditi, for their light?
VI, 51, 5. vísve âdityâh adite sa-góshâh asmábhyam sárma bahulám ví yanta.
p. 245
All ye Âdityas, Aditi together, grant to us your manifold protection!
X, 39, 11. ná tám râgânau adite kútah kaná ná ámhah asnoti duh-itám nákih bhayám.
O ye two kings (the Asvins), Aditi, no evil reaches him from anywhere, no misfortune, no fear (whom you protect). Cf. VII, 66, 6.
X, 63, 5. tâ´n â´ vivâsa námasâ suvriktí-bhih maháh âdityâ´n áditim svastáye.
I cherish them with worship and with hymns, the great Âdityas, Aditi, for happiness' sake.
X, 63, 17. evá platéh sûnúh avîvridhat vah vísve âdityâh adite manîshî´.
The wise son of Plati magnified you, all ye Âdityas, Aditi!
X, 65, 9. pargányâvâ´tâ vrishabhâ´ purîshínâ indravâyû´ (íti) várunah mitráh aryamâ´, devâ´n âdityâ´n áditim havâmahe yé pâ´rthivâsah divyâ´sah ap-sú yé.
There are Parganya and Vâta, the powerful, the givers of rain, Indra and Vâyu, Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, we call the divine Âdityas, Aditi, those who dwell on the earth, in heaven, in the waters.
We may not be justified in saying that there ever was a period in the history of the religious thought of India, a period preceding the worship of the Âdityas, when Aditi, the Infinite, was worshipped, though to the sage who first coined this name, it expressed, no doubt, for a time the principal, if not the only object of his faith and worship.
Aditi and Daksha.
Soon, however, the same mental process which led on later speculators from the earth to the elephant, and from the elephant to the tortoise, led the Vedic poets beyond Aditi, the Infinite. There was something beyond that Infinite which for a time they had grasped by the name of Aditi, and this, whether intentionally or by a mere accident of language, they called dáksha, literally power or the powerful. All this, no doubt, sounds strikingly modern, yet, though the passages in which this dáksha is mentioned are few in number, I should not venture to
p. 246
say that they are necessarily modern, even if by modern we mean only later than 1000 b.c. Nothing can bring the perplexity of the ancient mind, if once drawn into this vortex of speculation, more clearly before us than if we read:
X, 72, 4-5. âditeh dákshah agâyata dákshât ûm (íti) áditih pári,—áditih hí áganishta dáksha yâ´ duhitâ´ táva, tâ´m devâ´h ánu agâyanta bhadrâ´h amríta-bandhavah.
Daksha was born of Aditi, and Aditi from Daksha. For Aditi was born, O Daksha, she who is thy daughter; after her the gods were born, the blessed, who share in immortality.
Or, in more mythological language:
X, 64, 5. dákshasya vâ adite gánmani vraté râ´gânâ mitrâ´-várunâ â´ vivâsasi.
Or thou, O Aditi, nursest in the birthplace of Daksha the two kings, Mitra and Varuna.
Nay, even this does not suffice. There is something again beyond Aditi and Daksha, and one poet says:
X, 5, 7. ásat ka sát ka paramé ví-oman dákshasya gánman áditeh upá-sthe.
Not-being and Being are in the highest heaven, in the birthplace of Daksha, in the lap of Aditi.
At last something like a theogony, though full of contradictions, was imagined, and in the same hymn from which we have already quoted, the poet says:
X, 72, 1-4. devâ´nâm nú vayám gâ´nâ prá vokâma vipanyáyâ, ukthéshu sasyámâneshu yáh (yát?) pásyât ut-tare yugé. 1.
bráhmanah pátih etâ´ sám karmâ´rah-iva adhamat, devâ´nâm pûrvyé yugé ásatah sát agâyata. 2.
devâ´nâm yugé prathamé ásatah sát agâyata, tát â´sâh ánu agâyanta tát uttâná-padah pári. 3.
bhû´h gagñe uttâná-padah bhuváh â´sâh agâyanta, áditeh dákshah agâyata, dákshât ûm (íti) áditih pári. 4.
1. Let us now with praise proclaim the births of the gods, that a man may see them in a future age, whenever these hymns are sung.
2. Brahmanaspati a blew them together like a smith (with

p. 247
his bellows); in a former age of the gods, Being was born from Not-being.
3. In the first age of the gods, Being was born from Not-being, after it were born the Regions (space), from them Uttânapada;
4. From Uttânapad the Earth was born, the Regions were born from the Earth. Daksha was born of Aditi, and Aditi from Daksha.
The ideas of Being and Not-being (τὸ ὄν and τὸ μὴ ὄν) are familiar to the Hindus from a very early time in their intellectual growth, and they can only have been the result of abstract speculation. Therefore dáksha, too, in the sense of power or potentia, may have been a metaphysical conception. But it may also have been suggested by a mere accident of language, a never-failing source of ancient thoughts. The name dáksha-pitarah, an epithet of the gods, has generally been translated by 'those who have Daksha for their father.' But it may have been used originally in a very different sense. Professor Roth has, I think, convincingly proved that this epithet dáksha-pitar, as given to certain gods, does not mean, the gods who have Daksha for their father, but that it had originally the simpler meaning of fathers of strength, or, as he translates it, 'preserving, possessing, granting faculties a.' This is particularly clear in one passage:
III, 27, 9. bhûtâ´nâm gárbham â´ dadhe, dákshasya, pitáram.
I place Agni, the source of all beings, the father of strength …

p. 248
After this we can hardly hesitate how to translate the next verse:
VI, 50, 2. su-gyótishah—dáksha-pitrîn—devâ´n.
The resplendent gods, the fathers of strength.
It may seem more doubtful, when we come to gods like Mitra and Varuna, whom we are so much accustomed to regard as Âdityas, or sons of Aditi, and who therefore, according to the theogony mentioned before, would have the best claim to the name of sons of Daksha; yet here, too, the original and simple meaning is preferable; nay, it is most likely that from passages like this, the later explanation, which makes Mitra and Varuna the sons of Daksha, may have sprung.
VII, 66, 2. yâ´—su-dákshâ dáksha-pitarâ.
Mitra and Varuna, who are of good strength, the fathers of strength.
Lastly, even men may claim this name; for, unless we change the accent, we must translate:
VIII, 63, 10. avasyávah yushmâ´bhih dáksha-pitarah.
We suppliants, being, through your aid, fathers of strength.
But whatever view we take, whether we take dáksha in the sense of power, as a personification of a philosophical conception, or as the result of a mythological misunderstanding occasioned by the name of dáksha-pitar, the fact remains that in certain hymns of the Rig-veda (VIII, 25, 5) Dáksha, like Aditi, has become a divine person, and has retained his place as one of the Âdityas to the very latest time of Purânic tradition.
Aditi in her Cosmic Character.
But to return to Aditi. Let us look upon her as the Infinite personified, and most passages, even those where she is presented as a subordinate deity, will become intelligible.
Aditi, in her cosmic character, is the Beyond, the unbounded realm beyond earth, sky, and heaven, and originally she was distinct from the sky, the earth, and the ocean. Aditi is mentioned by the side of heaven and earth, which
p. 249
shows that, though in more general language she may be identified with heaven and earth in their unlimited character, her original conception was different. This we see in passages where different deities or powers are invoked together, particularly if they are invoked together in the same verse, and where Aditi holds a separate place by the side of heaven and earth:
I, 94, 16 (final). tát nah mitráh várunah mamahantâm áditih síndhuh prithivî´ utá dyaúh.
May Mitra and Varuna grant us this, may Aditi, Sindhu (sea), the Earth, and the Sky!
In other passages, too, where Aditi has assumed a more personal character, she still holds her own by the side of heaven and earth; cf. IX, 97, 58 (final):
I, 191, 6. dyaûh vah pitâ´ prithivî´ mâtâ´ sómah bhrâ´tâ áditih svásâ.
The Sky is your father, the Earth your mother, Soma your brother, Aditi your sister.
VIII, 101, 15. mâtâ´ rudrâ´nâm duhitâ´ vásûnâm svásâ âdityâ´nâm amrítasya nâ´bhih, prá nú vokam kikitúshe gánâya mâ´ gâ´m ánâgâm áditim vadhishta.
The mother of the Rudras, the daughter of the Vasus, the sister of the Âdityas, the source of immortality, I tell it forth to the man of understanding, may he not offend the cow, the guiltless Aditi! Cf. I, 153, 3; IX, 96, 15; Vâgasan. Samhitâ XIII, 49.
VI, 51, 5. dyaũh pítar (íti) príthivi mâ´tah ádhruk ágne bhrâtah vasavah mriláta nah, vísve âdityâh adite sa-góshâh asmábhyam sárma bahulám vi yanta.
Sky, father, Earth, kind mother, Fire, brother, bright gods, have mercy upon us! All Âdityas (and) Aditi together, grant us your manifold protection!
X, 63, 10. su-trâ´mânam prithivî´m dyâ´m anehásam susármânam áditim su-pránîtim, daívîm nâ´vam su-aritrâ´m ánâgasam ásravantîm â´ ruhema svastáye.
Let us for welfare step into the divine boat, with good oars, faultless and leakless—the well-protecting Earth, the peerless Sky, the sheltering, well-guiding Aditi!
X, 66, 4. áditih dyâ´vâprithivî´ (íti).
p. 250
Aditi, and Heaven and Earth.
Where two or more verses come together, the fact that Aditi is mentioned by the side of Heaven and Earth may seem less convincing, because in these Nivids or long strings of invocations different names or representatives of one and the same power are not unfrequently put together. For instance,
X, 36, 1-3. ushásânáktâ brihatî´ (íti) su-pésasâ dyâ´vâkshâ´mâ várunah mitráh aryamâ´, índram huve marútah párvatân apáh âdityâ´n dyâ´vâprithivî´ (íti) apáh svãr (íti svãh). 1.
dyaúh ka nah prithivî´ ka prá-ketasâ ritávarî (íty ritávarî) rakshatâm ámhasah risháh, mâ´ duh-vidátrâ níh-ritih nah îsata tát devâ´nâm ávah adyá vrinîmahe. 2.
vísvasmât nah áditih pâtu ámhasah mâtâ´ mitrásya várunasya revátah svãh-vat gyótih avrikám nasîmahi. 3.
1. There are the grand and beautiful Morning and Night, Heaven and Earth, Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman; I call Indra, the Maruts, the Waters, the Âdityas, Heaven and Earth, the Waters, the Heaven.
2. May Heaven and Earth, the provident, the righteous, preserve us from sin and mischief! May the malevolent Nirriti not rule over us! This blessing of the gods we ask for to-day.
3. May Aditi protect us from all sin, the mother of Mitra and of the rich Varuna! May we obtain heavenly light without enemies! This blessing of the gods we ask for to-day.
Here we cannot but admit that Dyâ´vâkshâ´mâ, heaven and earth, is meant for the same divine couple as Dyâ´vâprithivî´, heaven and earth, although under slightly differing names they are invoked separately. The waters are invoked twice in the same verse and under the same name; nor is there any indication that, as in other passages, the waters of the sky are meant as distinct from the waters of the sea. Nevertheless even here, Aditi, who in the third verse is called distinctly the mother of Mitra and Varuna, cannot well have been meant for the same deity as Heaven and Earth, mentioned in the second verse; and the author of
p. 251
these two verses, while asking the same blessing from both, must have been aware of the original independent character of Aditi.
Aditi as Mother.
In this character of a deity of the far East, of an Orient in the true sense of the word, Aditi was naturally thought of as the mother of certain gods, particularly of those that were connected with the daily rising and setting of the sun. If it was asked whence comes the dawn, or the sun, or whence come day and night, or Mitra and Varuna, or any of the bright, solar, eastern deities, the natural answer was that they come from the Orient, that they are the sons of Aditi. Thus we read in
IX, 74, 3. urvî´ gávyûtih áditeh ritám yaté.
Wide is the space for him who goes on the right path of Aditi.
In VIII, 25, 3, we are told that Aditi bore Mitra and Varuna, and these in verse 5 are called the sons of Daksha (power), and the grandsons of Savas, which again means might: nápâtâ sávasah manáh sûnû´ (íti) dákshasya su-krátû (íti). In X, 36, 3, Aditi is called the mother of Mitra and Varuna; likewise in X, 132, 6; see also VI, 67, 4. In VIII, 47, 9, Aditi is called the mother of Mitra, Aryaman, Varuna, who in VII, 60, 5 are called her sons. In X, 11, 1, Varuna is called yahváh áditeh, the son of Aditi (cf. VIII, 19, 12); in VII, 41, 2, Bhaga is mentioned as her son. In X, 72, 8, we hear of eight sons of Aditi, but it is added that she approached the gods with seven sons only, and that the eighth (mârtândá, addled egg) was thrown away: ashtaú putrâ´sah áditeh yé gâtâ´h tanvãh pári, devâ´n úpa prá ait saptá-bhih párâ mârtândám âsyat.
In X, 63, 2, the gods in general are represented as born from Aditi, the waters, and the earth: yé sthá gâtâ´h áditeh at-bhyáh pári yé prithivyâ´h té me ihá sruta hávam.
You who are born of Aditi, from the water, you who are born of the earth, hear ye all my call!
The number seven, with regard to the Âdityas, occurs also in
p. 252
IX, 114, 3. saptá dísah nâ´nâ-sûryâh saptá hótârah ritvígah, devâ´h âdityâ´h yé saptá tébhih soma abhí raksha nah.
There are seven regions with their different suns, there are seven Hotars as priests, those who are the seven gods, the Âdityas, with them, O Soma, protect us!
The Seven Âdityas.
This number of seven Âdityas requires an explanation. To say that seven is a solemn or sacred number is to say very little, for however solemn or sacred that number may be elsewhere, it is not more sacred than any other number in the Veda. The often-mentioned seven rivers have a real geographical foundation, like the seven hills of Rome. The seven flames or treasures of Agni (V, 1, 5) and of Soma and Rudra (VI, 74, I), the seven paridhis or logs at certain sacrifices (X, 90, 15), the seven Harits or horses of the sun, the seven Hotar priests (III, 7, 7; 10, 4), the seven cities of the enemy destroyed by Indra (I, 63, 7), and even the seven Rishis (X, 82, 2; 109, 4), all these do not prove that the number of seven was more sacred than the number of one or three or five or ten used in the Veda in a very similar way. With regard to the seven Âdityas, however, we are still able to see that their number of seven or eight had something to do with solar movements. If their number had always been eight, we should feel inclined to trace the number of the Âdityas back to the eight regions, or the eight cardinal points of the heaven. Thus we read:
I, 35, 8. ashtaú ví akhyat kakúbhah prithivyâ´h.
The god Savitar lighted up the eight points of the earth (not the eight hills).
But we have seen already that though the number of Âdityas was originally supposed to have been eight, it was reduced to seven, and this could hardly be said in any sense of the eight points of the compass. Cf. Taitt. Âr. I, 7, 6.
As we cannot think in ancient India of the seven planets, I can only suggest the seven days or tithis of the four parvans of the lunar month as a possible prototype of the
p. 253
[paragraph continues]
Âdityas. This might even explain the destruction of the eighth Âditya, considering that the eighth day of each parvan, owing to its uncertainty, might be represented as exposed to decay and destruction. This would explain such passages as,
IV, 7, 5. yágishtham saptá dhâ´ma-bhih.
Agni, most worthy of sacrifice in the seven stations.
IX, 102, 2. yagñásya saptá dhâ´ma-bhih.
In the seven stations of the sacrifice.
The seven threads of the sacrifice may have the same origin:
II, 5, 2. â´ yásmin saptá rasmáyah tatâ´h yagñásya netári, manushvát daívyam ashtamám.
In whom, as the leader of the sacrifice, the seven threads are stretched out,—the eighth divine being is manlike (?).
The sacrifice itself is called, X, 124, 1, saptá-tantu, having seven threads.
X, 122, 3. saptá dhâ´mâni pari-yán ámartyah.
Agni, the immortal, who goes round the seven stations.
X, 8, 4. usháh-ushah hí vaso (íti) ágram éshi tvám yamáyoh abhavah vi-bhâ´vâ, ritâ´ya saptá dadhishe padâ´ni ganáyan mitrám tanvẽ svâ´yai.
For thou, Vasu (Agni), comest first every morning, thou art the illuminator of the twins (day and night). Thou holdest the seven places for the sacrifice, creating Mitra (the sun) for thy own body.
X, 5, 6. saptá maryâ´dâh kaváyah tatakshuh tâ´sâm ékâm ít abhí amhuráh gât.
The sages established the seven divisions, but mischief befell one of them.
I, 22, 16. átah devâ´h avantu nah yátah víshnuh vi-kakramé prithivyâ´h saptá dhâ´ma-bhih.
May the gods protect us from whence Vishnu strode forth, by the seven stations of the earth!
Even the names of the seven or eight Âdityas are not definitely known, at least not from the hymns of the Rig-veda. In II, 27, 1, we have a list of six names: Mitrá, Aryamán, Bhága, Váruna, Dáksha, Ámsah. These with Aditi would give us seven. In VI, 50, 1, we have Áditi,
p. 254
[paragraph continues]
Váruna, Mitrá, Agní, Aryamán, Savitár, and Bhága. In I, 89, 3, Bhága, Mitrá, Áditi, Dáksha, Aryamán, Váruna, Sóma, Asvínâ, and Sárasvatî are invoked together with an old invocation, pû´rvayâ ni-vídâ. In the Taittirîya-âranyaka, I, 13, 3, we find the following list: 1. Mitra, 2. Varuna, 3. Dhâtar, 4. Aryaman, 5. Amsa, 6. Bhaga, 7. Indra, 8. Vivasvat, but there, too, the eighth son is said to be Mârtânda, or, according to the commentator, Âditya.
The character of Aditi as the mother of certain gods is also indicated by some of her epithets, such as râ´ga-putrâ, having kings for her sons; su-putrâ´, having good sons; ugrá-putrâ, having terrible sons:
II, 27, 7. pípartu nah áditih râ´ga-putrâ áti dvéshâmsi aryamâ´ su-gébhih, brihát mitrásya várunasya sárma úpa syâma puru-vî´râh árishtâh.
May Aditi with her royal sons, may Aryaman carry us on easy roads across the hatreds; may we with many sons and without hurt obtain the great protection of Mitra and Varuna!
III, 4, 11. barhíh nah âstâm áditih su-putrâ´.
May Aditi with her excellent sons sit on our sacred pile!
VIII, 67, 11. párshi dîné gabhîré â´ úgra-putre gíghâmsatah, mâ´kih tokásya nah rishat.
Protect us, O goddess with terrible sons, from the enemy in shallow or deep water, and no one will hurt our offspring!
Aditi identified with other Deities.
Aditi, however, for the very reason that she was originally intended for the Infinite, for something beyond the visible world, was liable to be identified with a number of finite deities which might all be represented as resting on Aditi, as participating in Aditi, as being Aditi. Thus we read:
I, 89, 10 (final). áditih dyaûh áditih antáriksham áditih mâtâ´ sáh pitâ´ sáh putráh, vísve devâ´h áditih páñka gánâh áditih gâtám áditih gáni-tvam.
Aditi is the heaven, Aditi the sky, Aditi the mother, the
p. 255
father, the son. All the gods are Aditi, the five clans, the past is Aditi, Aditi is the future.
But although Aditi may thus be said to be everything, heaven, sky, and all the gods, no passage occurs, in the Rig-veda at least, where the special meaning of heaven or earth is expressed by Aditi. In X, 63, 3, where Aditi seems to mean sky, we shall see that it ought to be taken as a masculine, either in the sense of Âditya, or as an epithet, unbounded, immortal. In I, 72, 9, we ought probably to read prithvî´ and pronounce prithuvî´, and translate 'the wide Aditi, the mother with her sons;' and not, as Benfey does, 'the Earth, the eternal mother.'
It is more difficult to determine whether in one passage Aditi has not been used in the sense of life after life, or as the name of the place whither people went after death, or of the deity presiding over that place. In a well-known hymn, supposed to have been uttered by Sunahsepa when on the point of being sacrificed by his own father, the following verse occurs:
I, 24, 1. káh nah mahyaí áditaye púnah dât, pitáram ka driséyam mâtáram ka.
Who will give us back to the great Aditi, that I may see father and mother?
As the supposed utterer of this hymn is still among the living, Aditi can hardly be taken in the sense of earth, nor would the wish to see father and mother be intelligible in the mouth of one who is going to he sacrificed by his own father. If we discard the story of Sunahsepa, and take the hymn as uttered by any poet who craves for the protection of the gods in the presence of danger and death, then we may choose between the two meanings of earth or liberty, and translate, either, Who will give us back to the great earth? or, Who will restore us to the great Aditi, the goddess of freedom?
Aditi and Diti.
There is one other passage which might receive light if we could take Aditi in the sense of Hades, but I give this translation as a mere guess:
p. 256
IV, 2, 11. râyé ka nah su-apatyâ´ya deva dítim ka râ´sva áditim urushya.
That we may enjoy our wealth and healthy offspring, give us this life on earth, keep off the life to come! Cf. I, 152, 6.
It should be borne in mind that Diti occurs in the Rig-veda thrice only, and in one passage it should, I believe, be changed into Aditi. This passage occurs in VII, 15, 12. tvám agne vîrá-vat yásah deváh ka savitâ´ bhágah, dítih ka dâti vâ´ryam. Here the name of Diti is so unusual, and that of Aditi, on the contrary, so natural, that I have little doubt that the poet had put the name of Aditi; and that later reciters, not aware of the occasional license of putting two short syllables instead of one, changed it into Aditi. If we remove this passage, then Diti, in the Rig-veda at least, occurs twice only, and each time together or in contrast with Aditi; cf. V, 62, 8, page 243. I have no doubt, therefore, that Professor Roth is right when he says that Diti is a being without any definite conception, a mere reflex of Aditi. We can clearly watch her first emergence into existence through what is hardly more than a play of words, whereas in the epic and Purânic literature this Diti (like the Suras) has grown into a definite person, one of the daughters of Daksha, the wife of Kasyapa, the mother of the enemies of the gods, the Daityas. Such is the growth of legend, mythology and religion!
Aditi in her Moral Character.
Besides the cosmical character of Aditi, which we have hitherto examined, this goddess has also assumed a very prominent moral character. Aditi, like Varuna, delivers from sin. Why this should be so, we can still understand if we watch the transition which led from a purely cosmical to a moral conception of Aditi. Sin in the Veda is frequently conceived as a bond or a chain from which the repentant sinner wishes to be freed:
VII, 86, 5. áva drugdhâ´ni pítryâ sriga nah áva yâ´ vayám kakrimá tanû´bhih, áva râgan pasu-trípam ná tâyúm srigá vatsám ná dâ´mnah vásishtham.
Absolve us from the sins of our fathers, and from those
p. 257
which we have committed with our own bodies. Release Vasishtha, O king, like a thief who has feasted on stolen cattle; release him like a calf from the rope a.
VIII, 67, 14. té nah âsnáh vríkânâm â´dityâsah mumókata stenám baddhám-iva adite.
O Âdityas, deliver us from the mouth of the wolves, like a bound thief, O Aditi! Cf. VIII, 67, 18.
Sunahsepa, who, as we saw before, wishes to be restored to the great Aditi, is represented as bound (dita) by ropes, and in V, 2, 7, we read:
súnah-sépam kit ní-ditam sahásrât yû´pât amuñkah ásamishta hí sáh, evá asmát agne ví mumugdhi pâ´sân hótar (íti) kikitvah ihá tú ni-sádya.
O Agni, thou hast released the bound Sunahsepa from the stake, for he had prayed; thus take from us, too, these ropes, O sagacious Hotar, after thou hast settled here.
Expressions like these, words like dâ´man, bond, ní-dita, bound, naturally suggested á-diti, the un-bound or unbounded, as one of those deities who could best remove the bonds of sin or misery. If we once realise this concatenation of thought and language, many passages of the Veda that seemed obscure, will become intelligible.
VII, 51, 1. âdityâ´nâm ávasâ nû´tanena sakshîmáhi sármanâ sám-tamena, anâgâh-tvé aditi-tvé turâ´sah imám yagñám dadhatu sróshamânâh.
May we obtain the new favour of the Âdityas, their best protection; may the quick Maruts listen and place this sacrifice in guiltlessness and Aditi-hood.
I have translated the last words literally, in order to make their meaning quite clear. Â´gas has the same meaning as the Greek ἄγος, guilt, abomination; an-âgâs-tvá, therefore, as applied to a sacrifice or to the man who makes it, means guiltlessness, purity. Aditi-tvá, Aditi-hood, has a similar meaning, it means freedom from bonds, from anything that hinders the proper performance of a religious act; it may come to mean perfection or holiness.

p. 258
Aditi having once been conceived as granting this adititvá, soon assumed a very definite moral character, and hence the following invocations:
I, 24, 15. út ut-tamám varuna pâ´sam asmát áva adhamám ví madhyamim srathaya, átha vayám âditya vraté táva ánâgasah áditaye syâma.
O Varuna, lift the highest rope, draw off the lowest, remove the middle; then, O Âditya, let us be in thy service free of guilt before Aditi.
V, 82, 6. ánâgasah áditaye devásya savitúh h savé, vísvâ vâmâ´ni dhîmahi.
May we, guiltless before Aditi, and in the keeping of the god Savitar, obtain all goods! Professor Roth here translates Aditi by freedom or security.
I, 162, 22. anâgâh-tvám nah áditih krinotu.
May Aditi give us sinlessness! Cf. VII, 51, 1.
IV, 12, 4. yát kit hí te purusha-trâ´ yavishtha ákitti-bhih kakrimá kit kit â´gah, kridhí sú asmâ´n áditeh ánâgân ví énâmsi sisrathah víshvak agne.
Whatever, O youthful god, we have committed against thee, men as we are, whatever sin through thoughtlessness, make us guiltless of Aditi, loosen the sins on all sides, O Agni!
VII, 93, 7. sáh agne enâ´ námasâ sám-iddhah ákkha mitrám várunam índram vokeh, yát sîm â´gah kakrimá tát sú mrila tát aryamâ´ áditih sisrathantu.
O Agni, thou who hast been kindled with this adoration, greet Mitra, Varuna, and Indra. Whatever sin we have committed, do thou pardon it! May Aryaman, Aditi loose it!
Here the plural sisrathantu should be observed, instead of the dual.
VIII, 18, 6-7. áditih nah dívâ pasúm áditih náktam ádvayâh, áditih pâtu ámhasah sadâ´-vridhâ.
utá syâ´ nah dívâ matíh áditih ûtyâ´ â´ gamat, sâ sám-tâti máyah karat ápa srídhah.
May Aditi by day protect our cattle, may she, who never deceives, protect by night; may she, with steady increase, protect us from evil!
And may she, the thoughtful Aditi, come with help to

us by day; may she kindly bring happiness to us, and carry away all enemies! Cf. X, 36, 3, page 251.
X, 87, 18. â´ vriskyantâm áditaye duh-évâh.
May the evil-doers be cut off from Aditi! or literally, may they be rooted out before Aditi!
II, 27, 24. ádite mítra váruna utá mrila yát vah vayám kakrimá kát kit â´gah, urú asyâm ábhayam gyótih indra mâ´ nah dîrghâ´h abhí nasan támisrâh.
Aditi, Mitra, and also Varuna forgive, if we have committed any sin against you. May I obtain the wide and fearless light, O Indra! May not the long darkness reach us!
VII, 87, 7. yáh mriláyâti kakrúshe kit â´gah vayám syâma várune ánâgâh, ánu vratâ´ni áditeh ridhántah yuyám pâta svastí-bhih sádâ nah.
May we be sinless before Varuna, who is gracious even to him who has committed sin, and may we follow the laws of Aditi! Protect us always with your blessings!
Lastly, Aditi, like all other gods, is represented as a giver of worldly goods, and implored to bestow them on her worshippers, or to protect them by her power:
I, 43, 2. yáthâ nah áditih kárat pásve nrí-bhyah yáthâ gáve, yáthâ tokâ´ya rudríyam.
That Aditi may bring Rudra's favour to our cattle, our men, our cow, our offspring.
I, 153, 3. pîpâ´ya dhenúh áditih ritâ´ya gánâya mitrâvarunâ havih-dé.
Aditi, the cow, gives food to the righteous man, O Mitra and Varuna, who makes offerings to the gods. Cf. VIII, 101, 15.
I, 185, 3. aneháh dâtrám áditeh anarvám huvé.
I call for the unrivalled, uninjured gift of Aditi. Here Professor Roth again assigns to Aditi the meaning of freedom or security.
VII, 40, 2. dídeshtu devî´ áditih réknah.
May the divine Aditi assign wealth!
X, 100, 1. â´ sarvá-tâtim áditim vrinîmahe.
We implore Aditi for health and wealth.
I, 94, 15. yásmai tvám su-dravinah dádâsah anâgâh-tvám
p. 260
adite sarvá-tâtâ, yám bhadréna sávasâ kodáyâsi pragâ´-vatâ râ´dhasâ té syâma.
To whom thou, possessor of good treasures, grantest guiltlessness, O Aditi, in health and wealth a, whom thou quickenest with precious strength and with riches in progeny, may we be they! Cf. II, 40, 6; IV, 25, 5; X, 11, 2.
The principal epithets of Aditi have been mentioned in the passages quoted above, and they throw no further light on the nature of the goddess. She was called devî´, goddess, again and again; another frequent epithet is anarván, uninjured, unscathed. Being invoked to grant light (VII, 82, 10), she is herself called luminous, gyótishmatî, I, 136, 3; and svâ´rvatî, heavenly. Being the goddess of the infinite expanse, she, even with greater right than the dawn, is called úrûkî, VIII, 67, 12; uruvyákas, V, 46, 6; uruvragâ, VIII, 67, 12; and possibly prithvî´ in I, 72, 9. As supporting everything, she is called dhârayátkshiti, supporting the earth, I, 136, 3; and visváganyâ, VII, 10, 4. To her sons she owes the names of râ´gaputrâ, II, 27, 7; suputrâ´, III, 4, 11; and ugráputrâ, VIII, 67, 11: to her wealth that of sudravinas, I, 94, 15, though others refer this epithet to Agni. There remains one name pastyẫ, IV, 55, 3; VIII, 27, 5, meaning housewife, which again indicates her character as mother of the gods.
 
I have thus given all the evidence that can be collected from the Rig-veda as throwing light on the character of the goddess Aditi, and I have carefully excluded everything that rests only on the authority of the Yagur- or Atharva-vedas, or of the Brâhmanas and Âranyakas, because in all they give beyond the repetitions from the Rig-veda, they seem to me to represent a later phase of thought that ought not to be mixed up with the more primitive conceptions of the Rig-veda. Not that the Rig-veda is free from what seems decidedly modern, or at all events secondary and late. But it is well to keep the great collections, as such,

p. 261
separate, whatever our opinions may be as to the age of their component parts.
In the Atharva-veda Aditi appears more unintelligible, more completely mythological, than in the Rig-veda. We read, for instance, Atharva-veda VII, 6, 1:
‘Aditi is the sky, Aditi is the welkin, Aditi is mother, is father, is son; all the gods are Aditi, and the five clans of men; Aditi is what was, Aditi is what will be.
‘We invoke for our protection the great mother of the well-ruling gods, the wife of Rita, the powerful, never-aging, far-spreading, the sheltering, well-guiding Aditi.’
In the Taittirîya-âranyaka and similar works the mythological confusion becomes greater still. Much valuable material for an analytical study of Aditi may be found in B. and R.'s Dictionary, and in several of Dr. Muir's excellent contributions to a knowledge of Vedic theogony and mythology.
Aditi as an Adjective.
But although the foregoing remarks give as complete a description of Aditi as can be gathered from the hymns of the Rig-veda, a few words have to be added on certain passages where the word áditi occurs, and where it clearly cannot mean the goddess Aditi, as a feminine, but must be taken either as the name of a corresponding masculine deity, or as an adjective in the sense of unrestrained, independent, free.
V, 59, 8. mímâtu dyaúh áditih vîtáye nah.
May the boundless Dyú (sky) help us to our repast!
Here Aditi must either be taken in the sense of Âditya, or better in its original sense of unbounded, as an adjective belonging to Dyú, the masculine deity of the sky.
Dyú or the sky is called áditi or unbounded in another passage, X, 63, 3:
yébhyah mâtâ´ mádhu-mat pínvate páyah pîyû´sham dyaûh áditih ádri-barhâh.
The gods to whom their mother yields the sweet milk, and the unbounded sky, as firm as a rock, their food.
IV, 3, 8. kathâ´ sárdhâya marútâm ritâ´ya kathâ´ sûré brihaté prikkhyámânah, práti bravah áditaye turâ´ya.
p. 262
How wilt thou tell it to the host of the Maruts, how to the bright heaven, when thou art asked? How to the quick Aditi?
Here Aditi cannot be the goddess, partly on account of the masculine gender of turâ´ya, partly because she is never called quick. Aditi must here be the name of one of the Âdityas, or it may refer back to sûré brihaté. It can hardly be joined, as Professor Roth proposes, with sárdhâya marútâm, owing to the intervening sûré brihaté.
In several passages áditi, as an epithet, refers to Agni:
IV, 1, 20 (final). vísveshâm áditih yagñíyânâm vísveshâm átithih mâ´nushânâm.
He, Agni, the Aditi, or the freest, among all the gods; he the guest among all men.
The same play on the words áditi and átithi occurs again:
VII, 9, 3. ámûrah kavíh áditih vivásvân su-samsát mitráh átithih siváh nah, kitrá-bhânuh ushásâm bhâti ágre.
The wise poet, Aditi, Vivasvat, Mitra with his good company, our welcome guest, he (Agni) with brilliant light came at the head of the dawns.
Here, though I admit that several renderings are possible, Aditi is meant as a name of Agni, to whom the whole hymn is addressed, and who, as usual, is identified with other gods, or, at all events, invoked by their names. We may translate áditih vivásvân by 'the brilliant Aditi,' or 'the unchecked, the brilliant,' or by 'the boundless Vivasvat,' but on no account can we take áditi here as the female goddess. The same applies to VIII, 19, 14, where Aditi, unless we suppose the goddess brought in in the most abrupt way, must be taken as a name of Agni; while in X, 92, 14, áditim anarvánam, to judge from other epithets given in the same verse, has most likely to be taken again as an appellative of Agni. In some passages it would, no doubt, be possible to take Aditi as the name of a female deity, if it were certain that no other meaning could be assigned to this word. But if we once know that Aditi was the name of a male deity also, the structure of these passages becomes far more perfect, if we take Aditi in that sense:
p. 263
IV, 39, 3. ánâgasam tám áditih krinotu sáh mitréna várunena sa-góshâh.
May Aditi make him free from sin, he who is allied with Mitra and Varuna.
We have had several passages in which Aditi, the female deity, is represented as sagóshâh or allied with other Âdityas, but if sáh is the right reading here, Aditi in this verse can only be the male deity. The pronoun sá cannot refer to tám.
With regard to other passages, such as IX, 81, 5; VI, 51, 3, and even some of those translated above in which Aditi has been taken as a female goddess, the question must be left open till further evidence can be obtained. There is only one more passage which has been often discussed, and where áditi was supposed to have the meaning of earth:
VII, 18, 8. duh-âdhyãh áditim sreváyantah aketásah ví gagribhre párushnîm.
Professor Roth in one of his earliest essays translated this line, 'The evil-disposed wished to dry the earth, the fools split the Parushnî,' and he supposed its meaning to have been that the enemies of Sudâs swam across the Parushnî in order to attack Sudâs. We might accept this translation, if it could be explained how by throwing themselves into the river, the enemies made the earth dry, though even then there would remain this difficulty that, with the exception of one other doubtful passage, discussed before, áditi never means earth. We might possibly translate: 'The evil-disposed, the fools, laid dry and divided the boundless river Parushnî.' This would be a description of a stratagem very common in ancient warfare, viz. diverting the course of a river and laying its original bed dry by digging a new channel, and thus dividing the old river. This is also the sense accepted by Sâyana, who does not say that vigraha means dividing the waves of a river, as Professor Roth renders kûlabheda, but that it means dividing or cutting through its banks. In the Dictionary Professor Roth assigns to áditi in this passage the meaning of endless, inexhaustible.
p. 264
Kaná.
Note 5. Nothing is more difficult in the interpretation of the Veda than to gain an accurate knowledge of the power of particles and conjunctions. The particle kaná, we are told, is used both affirmatively and negatively, a statement which shows better than anything else the uncertainty to which every translation of Vedic hymns is as yet exposed. It is perfectly true that in the text of the Rig-veda, as we now read it, kaná means both indeed and no. But this very fact shows that we ought to distinguish where the first collectors of the Vedic hymns have not distinguished, and that while in the former case we read kaná, we ought in the latter to read ka ná.
I begin with those passages in which kaná is used emphatically, though originally it may have been a double negation.


I, 18, 7. yásmât rité ná sídhyati yagñáh vipah-kítah kaná.
Without whom the sacrifice does not succeed, not even that of the sage.
V, 34, 5. ná ásunvatâ sakate púshyatâ kaná.
He does not cling to a man who offers no libations, even though he be thriving.
I, 24, 6. nahí te kshatrám ná sáhah ná manyúm váyah kaná amî´ (íti) patáyantah âpúh.
For thy power, thy strength, thy anger even these birds which fly up, do not reach. Cf. I, 100, 15.
I, 155, 5. tritî´yam asya nákih â´ dadharshati váyah kaná patáyantah patatrínah.
This third step no one approaches, not even the winged birds which fly up.
I, 55, 1. diváh kit asya varimâ´ ví papratha, índram ná mahnâ´ prithivî´ kaná práti.
The width of the heavens is stretched out, even the earth in her greatness is no match for Indra.


VII, 32, 13. pûrvî´h kaná prá-sitayah taranti tám yáh índre kármanâ bhúvat.
p. 265
Even many snares pass him who is with Indra in his work.
VIII, 2, 14. ukthám kanâ sasyámânam ágoh aríh â´ kiketa, ná gâyatrám gîyámânam.
He (Indra) marks indeed a poor man's prayer that is recited, but not a hymn that is sung. (Doubtful.)
VIII, 78, 10. táva ít indra ahám â-sásâ háste dâ´tram kaná â´ dade.
Hoping in thee alone, O Indra, I take even this sickle in my hand.
I, 55, 5. ádha kaná srát dadhati tvíshi-mate índrâya vágram ni-ghánighnate vadhám.
Then indeed they believe in Indra, the majestic, when he hurls the bolt to strike.
I, 152, 2. etát kaná tvah ví kiketat eshâm.
Does one of them understand even this?
IV, 18, 9. mámat kaná used in the same sense as mámat kit.
I, 139, 2. dhîbhíh kaná mánasâ svébhih akshá-bhih.
V, 41, 13. váyah kaná su-bhvãh â´ áva yanti.
VII, 18, 9. âsúh kaná ít abhi-pitvám gagâma.
VIII, 91, 3. â´ kaná tvâ kikitsâmah ádhi kaná tvâ ná imasi.
We wish to know thee, indeed, but we cannot understand thee.
X, 49, 5. ahám randhayam mrígayam srutárvane yát mâ ágihîta vayûnâ kaná ânu-shák.
VI, 26, 7. ahám kaná tát sûrí-bhih ânasyâm.
May I also obtain this with the lords.


I, 74, 7. ná yóh upabdíh ásvyah srinvé ráthasya kát kaná, yát agne yâ´si dûtyâ´m.
No sound of horses is heard, and no sound of the chariot, when thou, O Agni, goest on thy message.
I, 81, 5. ná tvâ´-vân indra káh kaná ná gâtáh ná ganishyaté.
No one is like thee, O Indra, no one has been born, no one will be!
p. 266
I, 84, 20. mâ´ te râ´dhâmsi mâ´ to ûtáyah vaso (íti) asmâ´n kádâ kaná dabhan.
May thy gifts, may thy help, O Vasu, never fail us!
Many more passages might be given to illustrate the use of kaná or kás kaná and its derivatives in negative sentences.
Cf. I, 105, 3; 136, 1; 139, 5; II, 16, 3; 23, 5; 28, 6; III, 36, 4; IV, 31, 9; V, 42, 6; 82, 2; VI, 3, 2; 20, 4; 47, 1; 3; 48, 17; 54, 9; 59, 4; 69, 8; 75, 16; VII, 32, 1; 19; 59, 3; 82, 7; 104, 3; VIII, 19, 6; 23, 15; 24, 15; 28, 4; 47, 7; 64, 27, 66, 13; 68, 19; IX, 61, 27; 69, 6; 114, 4; X, 33, 9; 39, 11; 48, 5; 49, 10; 59, 8; 62, 9; 85, 3; 86, 11; 95, 1; 112, 9; 119, 6; 7; 128, 4; 129, 2; 152, 1; 168, 3; 185, 2.


III, 30, 1. títikshante abhí-sastim gánânâm índra tvát â´ káh kaná hí pra-ketáh.
They bear the scoffing of men; for, Indra, from thee comes every wisdom.
I, 113, 8. ushâ´h mritám kám kaná bodháyantî.
Ushas, who wakes every dead (or one who is as if dead).
I, 191, 7. âdrishtâh kím kaná ihá vah sárve sâkám ní gasyata.
Invisible ones, whatever you are, vanish all together!
 
II. We now come to passages in which kaná stands for ka ná, and therefore renders the sentence negative without any further negative particle. It might seem possible to escape from this admission, by taking certain sentences in an interrogative sense. But this would apply to certain sentences only, and would seem forced even there:
II, 16, 2. yásmât índrât brihatáh kím kaná îm rité. Beside whom, (beside) the great Indra, there is not anything.
II, 24, 12. vísvam satyám magha-vânâ yuvóh ít â´pah kaná prá minanti vratám vâm.
Everything, you mighty ones, belongs indeed to you; even the waters do not transgress your law.
p. 267
IV, 30, 3. vísve kaná ít anâ´ tvâ devâ´sah indra yuyudhuh.
Even all the gods do not ever fight thee, O Indra.
V, 34, 7. duh-gé kaná dhriyate vísvah â´ purú gánah yáh asya távishîm ákukrudhat.
Even in a stronghold many a man is not often preserved who has excited his anger.
VII, 83, 2. yásmin âgâ´ bhávati kím kaná priyám.
In which struggle there is nothing good whatsoever.
VII, 86, 6. svápnah kaná ít ánritasya pra-yotâ´.
Even sleep does not remove all evil.
In this passage I formerly took kaná as affirmative, not as negative, and therefore assigned to prayotâ´ the same meaning which Sâyana assigns to it, one who brings or mixes, whereas it ought to be, as rightly seen by Roth, one who removes.
VIII, 1, 5. mahé kaná tvâ´m adri-vah párâ sulkâ´ya deyâm, ná sahásrâya ná ayútâya vagri-vah ná satâ´ya sata-magha.
I should not give thee up, wielder of the thunderbolt, even for a great price, not for a thousand, not for ten thousand (?), not for a hundred, O Indra, thou who art possessed of a hundred powers!
VIII, 51, 7. kadâ´ kaná starî´h asi.
Thou art never sterile.
VIII, 52, 7. kadâ´ kaná prá yukkhasi.
Thou art never weary.
VIII, 55, 5. kákshushâ kaná sam-náse.
Not to be reached even with eye.
X, 56, 4. mahimnáh eshâm pitárah kanâ îsire.
Note 6. Considering the particular circumstances mentioned in this and the preceding hymn, of Indra's forsaking his companions, the Maruts, or even scorning their help, one feels strongly tempted to take tyágas in its etymological sense of leaving or forsaking, and to translate, by his forsaking you, or, if he should forsake you. The poet may have meant the word to convey that idea, which no doubt would be most appropriate here; but it must be confessed, at the same time, that in other passages where tyágas occurs, that meaning could hardly be ascribed to it. Strange as it may seem, no one who is acquainted with the general
p. 268
train of thought in the Vedic hymns can fail to see that tyágas in most passages means attack, onslaught; it may be even the instrument of an attack, a weapon. How it should come to take this meaning is indeed difficult to explain, and I do not wonder that Professor Roth in his Dictionary simply renders the word by forlornness, need, danger, or by estrangement, unkindness, malignity. But let us look at the passages. and we shall see that these abstract conceptions are quite out of place:
VIII, 47, 7. ná tám tigmám kaná tyágah ná drâsad abhí tám gurú.
No sharp blow, no heavy one, shall come near him whom you protect.
Here the two adjectives tigmá, sharp, and gurú, heavy, point to something tangible, and I feel much inclined, to take tyágas in this passage as a weapon, as something that is let off with violence, rather than in the more abstract sense of onslaught.
I, 169, 1. maháh kit asi tyágasah varûtâ´.
Thou art the shielder from a great attack.
IV, 43, 4. káh vâm maháh kit tyágasah abhî´ke urushyátam mâdhvî dasrâ nah ûtî´.
Who is against your great attack? Protect us with your help, O Asvins, ye strong ones.
Here Professor Roth seems to join maháh kit tyágasah abhî´ke urushyátam, but in that case it would be impossible to construe the first words, káh vâm.
I, 119, 8. ágakkhatam krípamânam parâ-váti pitúh svásya tyágasâ ní-bâdhitam.
You went from afar to the suppliant, who had been struck down by the violence of his own father.
According to Professor Roth tyágas would here mean forlornness, need, or danger. But níbâdhita is a strong verb, as we may see in
VIII, 64, 2. padâ´ panî´n arâdhásah ní bâdhasva mahâ´n asi.
Strike the useless Panis down with thy foot, for thou art great.
X, 18, 11. út svañkasva prithivi mâ´ ní bâdhathâh.
Open, O earth, do not press on him (i. e. the dead, who is
p. 269
to be buried; cf. M. M., Über Todtenbestattung, Zeitschrift der D. M. G., vol. ix, p. xv).
VII, 83, 6. yátra râ´ga-bhih dasá-bhih ní-bâdhitam prá su-dâ´sam â´vatam trítsu-bhih sahá.
Where you protected Sudâs with the Tritsus, when he was pressed or set upon by the ten kings.
Another passage in which tyágas occurs is,
VI, 62, 10. sánutyena tyágasâ mártyasya vanushyatâ´m ápi sîrshâ´ vavriktam.
By your covert attack turn back the heads of those even who harass the mortal.
Though this passage may seem less decisive, yet it is difficult to see how tyágasâ could here, according to Professor Roth, be rendered by forlornness or danger. Something is required by which enemies can be turned back. Nor can it be doubtful that sîrshâ´ is governed by vavriktam, meaning turn back their heads, for the same expression occurs again in I, 33, 5. párâ kit sîrshâ´ vavriguh té indra áyagvânah yágva-bhih spárdhamânâh.
Professor Ben fey translates this verse by, 'Kopfüber flohn sie alle vor dir;' but it may be rendered more literally, 'These lawless people fighting with the pious turned away their heads.'
X, 144, 6. evá tát índrah índunâ devéshu kit dhârayâte máhi tyágah.
Indeed through this draught Indra can hold out against that great attack even among the gods.
X, 79, 6. kím devéshu tyágah énah kakartha.
What insult, what sin hast thou committed among the gods?
In these two passages the meaning of tyágas as attack or assault is at least as appropriate as that proposed by Professor Roth, estrangement, malignity.
There remains one passage, VI, 3, 1. yám tvám mitréna várunah sa-góshâh déva pâ´si tyágasâ mártam ámhah.
I confess that the construction of this verse is not clear to me, and I doubt whether it is possible to use tyágasâ as a verbal noun governing an accusative. If this were possible, one might translate, 'The mortal whom thou, O God (Agni),
p. 270
[paragraph continues]
Varuna, together with Mitra, protectest by pushing back evil.' More probably we should translate, 'Whom thou protectest from evil by thy might.'
If it be asked how tyágas can possibly have the meaning which has been assigned to it in all the passages in which it occurs; viz. that of forcibly attacking or pushing away, we can only account for it by supposing that tyag, before it came to mean to leave, meant to push off, to drive away with violence (verstossen instead of verlassen). This meaning may still be perceived occasionally in the use of tyag; e. g. devâs tyagantu mâm, may the gods forsake me! i. e. may the gods drive me away! Even in the latest Sanskrit tyag is used with regard to an arrow that is let off. 'To expel' is expressed by nis-tyag. Those who believe in the production of new roots by the addition of prepositional prefixes might possibly see in tyag an original ati-ag, to drive off; but, however that may be, there is evidence enough to show that tyag expressed originally a more violent act of separation than it does in ordinary Sanskrit, though here, too, passages occur in which tyag may be translated by to throw, to fling; for instance, khe dhûlim yas tyaged ukkair mûrdhni tasyaiva sâ patet, he who throws up dust in the air, it will fall on his head. Ind. Spr. 1582.
Muk, too, is used in a similar manner; for instance, vagram mokshyate té mahendrah, Mahâbh. XIV, 263. Cf. Dhammapada, ver. 389.
Verse 13.
Note 1. Sámsa, masc., means a spell, whether for good or for evil, a blessing as well as a curse. It means a curse, or, at all events, a calumny:
I, 18, 3. mâ´ nah sámsah árarushah dhûrtíh prának mártyasya.
Let not the curse of the enemy, the onslaught of a mortal hurt us.
I, 94, 8. asmâ´kam sámsah abhí astu duh-dhyãh. May our curse overcome the wicked!
III, 18, 2. tápa sámsam árarushah.
Burn the curse of the enemy!
p. 271
VII, 25, 2. âré tám sámsam krinuhi ninitsóh.
Take far away the curse of the reviler! Cf. VII, 34, 12.


II, 31, 6. utá yah sámsam usígâm-iva smasi.
We desire your blessing as a blessing for suppliants.
X, 31, 1. â´ nah devâ´nâm úpa vetu sámsah.
May the blessing of the gods come to us!
X, 7, 1. urushyá nah urú-bhih deva sámsaih.
Protect us, god, with thy wide blessings!
II, 23, 10. mâ´ nah duh-sámsah abhi-dipsúh îsata prá susámsâh matí-bhih târishîmahi.
Let not an evil-speaking enemy conquer us; may we, enjoying good report, increase by our. prayers!
In some passages, however, as pointed out by Grassmann, sámsa may best be rendered by singer, praiser. Grassmann marks one passage only,
II, 26, 1. rigúh ít sámsah vanavat vanushyatáh.
May the righteous singer conquer his enemies.
He admits, however, doubtfully, the explanation of B. R., that rigúh sámsah may be taken as one word, meaning, 'requiring the right.' This explanation seems surrendered by B. R. in the second edition of their Dictionary, and I doubt whether sámsah can mean here anything but singer. That being so, the same meaning seems more appropriate in other verses also, which I formerly translated differently, e. g.
VII, 56, 19. imé sámsam vanushyatáh ní pânti.
They, the Maruts, protect the singer from his enemy.
Lastly, sámsa means praise, the spell addressed by men to the gods, or prayer:
I, 33, 7. prá sunvatáh stuvatáh sámsam âvah.
Thou hast regarded the prayer of him who offers libation and praise.
X, 42, 6. yásmin vayám dadhimá sámsam índre.
Indra in whom we place our hope. Cf. âsams, Westergaard, Radices Linguae Sanscritae, s. v. sams.
"
17,"MANDALA I, HYMN 167.","ASHTAKA II, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 4-5.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. O Indra, a thousand have been thy helps accorded to us, a thousand, O driver of the bays, have been thy most delightful viands. May thousands of treasures richly to enjoy, may goods 1 come to us a thousandfold.
2. May the Maruts come towards us with their aids, the mighty ones, or with their best aids from the great heaven, now that their furthest steeds have rushed forth on the distant shore of the sea;
3. There clings 1 to the Maruts one who moves in secret, like a man's wife (the lightning 2), and who is like a spear carried behind 3, well grasped, resplendent, gold-adorned; there is also with them Vâk (the voice of thunder), like unto a courtly, eloquent woman.
4. Far away the brilliant, untiring Maruts cling to their young maid, as if she belonged to them all 1; but the terrible ones did not drive away Rodasî (the lightning), for they wished her to grow 2 their friend.
5. When the divine Rodasî with dishevelled locks, the manly-minded, wished to follow them, she went, like Sûryâ (the Dawn), to the chariot of her servant, with terrible look, as with the pace of a cloud.
6. As soon as the poet with the libations, O Maruts, had sung his song, at the sacrifice, pouring out Soma, the youthful men (the Maruts) placed the young maid (in their chariot) as their companion for victory, mighty in assemblies.
p. 273
7. I praise what is the praiseworthy true greatness of those Maruts, that the manly-minded, proud, and strong one (Rodasî) drives with them towards the blessed mothers.
8. They protect 1 Mitra and Varuna from the unspeakable, and Aryaman also finds out the infamous. Even what is firm and unshakable is being shaken 2; but he who dispenses treasures 3, O Maruts, has grown (in strength).
9. No people indeed, whether near to us, or from afar, have ever found the end of your strength, O Maruts! The Maruts, strong in daring strength, have, like the sea, boldly 1 surrounded their haters.
10. May we to-day, may we to-morrow in battle be called the most beloved of Indra. We were so formerly, may we truly be so day by day, and may the lord of the Maruts be with us.
11. May this praise, O Maruts, this song of Mândârya, the son of Mâna, the poet, ask you with food for offspring for ourselves! May we have an invigorating autumn, with quickening rain!
p. 274
NOTES.
Ascribed to Agastya, addressed to the Maruts, but the first verse to Indra. Metre Trishtubh throughout.
No verse of this hymn occurs in the Sâma-veda, nor in the other Samhitâs.
Verse 1.
Note 1. We must keep vâga, as a general term, distinct from asva, horses, and go, cows, for the poets themselves distinguish between gavyántah, asvayántah, and vâgayántah; see IV, 17, 16; VI, 8, 6.
Verse 3.
Note 1. On mimyaksha, see before, I, 165, 1, note 2.
Note 2. The spear of the Maruts is meant for the lightning, and we actually find rishtí-vidyutah, having the lightning for their spear, as an epithet of the Maruts, I, 168, 5; V, 52, 13.
The rest of this verse is difficult, and has been variously rendered by different scholars. We must remember that the lightning is represented as the wife or the beloved of the Maruts. In that character she is called Rodasî´, with the accent on the last syllable, and kept distinct from ródasî, the dual, with the accent on the antepenultimate, which means heaven and earth.
This Rodasî´ occurs:
V, 56, 8. â´ yásmin tastháu su-ránâni bíbhratî sákâ marútsu rodasî´.
The chariot on which, carrying pleasant gifts, stands Rodasî among the Maruts.
VI, 50, 5. mimyáksha yéshu rodasî´ nú devî´.
To whom clings the divine Rodasî.
VI, 66, 6. ádha sma eshu rodasî´ svá-sokih â´ ámavatsu tasthau ná rókah.
When they (the Maruts) had joined the two Rodas, i. e. heaven and earth, then the self-brilliant Rodasî came among the strong ones.
The name of Ródasî, heaven and earth, is so much more frequent in the Rig-veda than that of Rodasî´, that in
p. 275
several passages the iti which stands after duals, has been wrongly inserted after Rodasî´ in the singular. It is so in our hymn, verse 4, where we must read rodasî´m instead of rodasî´ íti, and again in X, 92, 11.
Besides the lightning, however, the thunder also may be said to be in the company of the Maruts, to be their friend or their wife, and it is this double relationship which seems to be hinted at in our hymn.
The thunder is called Vâk, voice, the voice of heaven, also called by the author of the Anukramanî, Âmbhrinî. It was natural to identify this ambhrina with Greek ὄβριμος, terrible, particularly as it is used of the thunder, ὄβριμον ἐβρόντησε, Hes. Th. 839, and is applied to Athene as ὀβριομο-πάτρη. But there are difficulties pointed out by Curtius, Grundzüge, p. 532, which have not yet been removed. This Vâk says of herself (X, 125, 12) that she stretched the bow for Rudra, the father of the Maruts, that her birth-place is in the waters (clouds), and that she fills heaven and earth. See also X, 114, 8.
In I, 173, 3. antáh dûtáh ná ródasî karat vâ´k.
The voice (thunder) moved between heaven and earth, like a messenger.
In VIII, 100, 10 and 11, after it has been said that the thunderbolt lies hidden in the water, the poet says: yát vâ´k vádantî avi-ketanâ´ni râ´shtrî devâ´nâm ni-sasâ´da mandrâ, when the voice, the queen of the gods, the delightful, uttering incomprehensible sounds, sat down. If, in our verse, we take Vâk in the sense of thunder, but as a feminine, it seems to me that the poet, speaking of the lightning and thunder as the two companions of the Maruts, represents the first, Rodasî, or the lightning, as the recognised wife.. hiding herself in the house, while the other, the loud thunder. is represented as a more public companion of the Maruts, distinctly called vidatheshu pagrâ (verse 6), a good speaker at assemblies. This contrast, if it is really what the poet intended, throws a curious light on the social character of the Vedic times, as it presupposes two classes of wives, not necessarily simultaneous, however,—a house-wife, who stays at home and is not much seen, and a wife who appears in
p. 276
public and takes part in the society and conversation of the sabhâ, the assembly-room, and the vidathas, the meetings. The loud voice of the thunder as well as the usual hiding of the lightning might well suggest this comparison. That good manners, such as are required in public, and ready speech, were highly esteemed in Vedic times, we learn from such words as sabhéya and vidathyã. Sabhéya, from sabhâ, assembly, court, comes to mean courtly, polite; vidathyã, from vidatha, assembly, experienced, learned.
VIII, 4, 9. kandráh yâti sabhâ´m úpa.
Thy friend, Indra, goes brilliant towards the assembly.
X, 34, 6. sabhâ´m eti kitaváh.
The gambler goes to the assembly.
VI, 28, 6. brihát vah váyah ukyate sabhâ´su.
Your great strength is spoken of in the assemblies.
Wealth is described as consisting in sabhâs, houses, IV, 2, 5; and a friend is described as sabhâsaha, strong in the assembly, X, 71, 10.
Sabhéya is used as an epithet of vipra (II, 24, 13), and a son is praised as sabheya, vidathya, and sadanya, i. e. as distinguished in the assemblies.
Vidathyã, in fact, means much the same as sabheya, namely, good for, distinguished at vidathas, meetings for social, political, or religious purposes, IV, 21, 2; VII, 36, 8, &c.
Note 3. Úparâ ná rishtih. I do not see how uparâ can here mean the cloud, if it ever has that meaning. I take ûpara as opposed to pûrva, i. e. behind, as opposed to before. In that sense ûpara is used, X, 77, 3; X, 15, 2; 44, 7, &c. It would therefore mean the spear on the back, or the spear drawn back before it is hurled forward.
B. R. propose to read sam-vâk, colloquium, but they give no explanation. The reference to VS. IX, 2, is wrong.
Verse 4.
Note 1. The fourth verse carries on the same ideas which were hinted at in the third. We must again change rodasî´, the dual, into rodasî´m, which is sufficiently indicated by the accent. Yavyâ I take as an instrumental of yavî, or of
p. 277
yavyâ. It means the youthful maid, and corresponds to yuvati in verse 6. Yavyâ would be the exact form which Curtius (Grundzüge, p. 589) postulated as the Sanskrit prototype of Hebe a. Now, if the Maruts correspond to Mars in Latin, and to Ares in Greek, the fact that in the Iliad Hebe bathes and clothes Ares b, may be of some significance. Sâdhâranî is used in the sense of uxor communis, and would show a familiarity with the idea of polyandry recognised in the epic poetry of the Mahâhhârata.
But although the Maruts cling to this maid (the Vâk, or thunder), they do not cast off Rodasî, their lawful wife, the lightning, but wish her to grow for their friendship, i. e. as their friend.
Ayâ´sah yavyâ´ must be scanned   ̆  ̄̆  ̄  ̆  ̄  ̄. In VI 66, 5, ayâ´sah mahnâ´ must be scanned as   ̆  ̄̆  ̆  ̄  ̆  ̄  ̄ (mahimnâ?).
Note 2. Vrídham, as the accent shows, is here an infinitive governed by gushanta.
Verse 5.
See von Bradke, Dyaus Asura, p. 76.
Verse 6.
I translate arká by poet. The construction would become too cumbersome if we translated, 'as soon as the hymn with the libations was there for you, as soon as the sacrificer sang his song.'
Verse 7.
The meaning of the second line is obscure, unless we adopt Ludwig's ingenious view that Rodasî is here conceived as Eileithyia, the goddess who helps mothers in childbirth. I confess that it is a bold conjecture, and there is nothing in Vedic literature to support it. All I can say is that Eileithyia is in Greek, like Hebe (Yavyâ) and Ares (Marut), a child of Hera, and that lightning as well as dawn might become a symbol of birth. The etymology and the


p. 278
very form of Εἰλείθυια is doubtful, and so is that of Rodasî´. It is tempting to connect rodasî, in the sense of heaven and earth, with O. S. radur, A. S. ródor (Grimm, Myth. p. 662), but that is impossible. Cf. I, 101, 7.
Verse 8.
Note 1. I do not see how pânti, the plural, can refer to Mitra and Varuna, nor how these gods could here be introduced as acting the part of the Maruts. I therefore refer pânti to the Maruts, who may be said to protect Mitra and Varuna, day and night, and all that belongs to them, from evil and disgrace. Aryaman is then brought in, as being constantly connected with Mitrâ-varunau, and the finding out, the perceiving from a distance, of the infamous enemies, who might injure Mitrâ-varunau, is parenthetically ascribed to him. See Ludwig, Anmerkungen, p. 239.
Note 2. Kyavante cannot and need not be taken for kyâvayanti, though akyutakut is a common epithet of the Maruts. It is quite true that the shaking of the unshakable mountains is the work of the Maruts, but that is understood, even though it is not expressed. In V, 60, 3, we read, párvatah kit máhi vriddháh bibhâya, even the very great mountain feared, i. e. the Maruts.
Note 3. Dâti in dâ´tivâra has been derived by certain Sanskrit scholars from dâ, to give. It means, no doubt, gift, but it is derived from dâ (do, dyati), to share, and means first, a share, and then a gift. Dâ´tivâra is applied to the Maruts, V, 58, 2; III, 51, 9, and must therefore be applied to them in our passage also, though the construction becomes thereby extremely difficult. It means possessed of a treasure of goods which they distribute. The growing, too, which is here predicated by vavridhe, leads us to think of the Maruts, as in I, 37, 5, or of their friend Indra, I, 52, 2; 81, I; VI, 30, 1. It is never, so far as I know, applied to the sacrificer.
Verse 9.
Note 1. Dhrishatâ´ is used as an adverb; see I, 71, 5; 174, 4; II, 30, 4, &c. Perhaps tmanâ may be supplied as in I, 54, 4.
"
18,"MANDALA I, HYMN 168.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 6-7.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. To every sacrifice 1 you hasten together 2, you accept prayer after prayer, O quick Maruts! Let me therefore bring you hither by my prayers from heaven and earth, for our welfare, and for our great protection;

3. Those Maruts, like Soma-drops 1, which squeezed from ripe stems dwell, when drunk, in the hearts of the worshipper—see how on their shoulders there clings as if a clinging wife; in their hands the quoit is held and the sword.
4. Lightly they have come down from heaven of their own accord: Immortals, stir yourselves with the whip! The mighty Maruts on dustless paths, armed with brilliant spears, have shaken down even the strong places.
5. O ye Maruts, who are armed with lightning-spears, who stirs you from within by himself, as the jaws are stirred by the tongue 1? You shake the sky 2, as if on the search for food; you are invoked by many 3, like the (solar) horse of the day 4.
6. Where, O Maruts, is the top, where the bottom of the mighty sky where you came? When you throw down with the thunderbolt what is strong, like brittle things, you fly across the terrible sea!

7. As your conquest is violent, splendid, terrible, full and crushing, so, O Maruts, is your gift delightful, like the largess of a liberal worshipper, wide-spreading, laughing like heavenly lightning.

9. Prisni 1 brought forth for the great fight the terrible train of the untiring Maruts: when fed they produced the dark cloud 3, and then looked about for invigorating food 2.

p. 281
NOTES.
This hymn is ascribed to Agastya. Verses 1-7, Gagatî; 8-10, Trishtubh. No verse of this hymn occurs in the SV., VS., TS., AS.
Verse 1.
There can be little doubt that the text of the first line is corrupt. Ludwig admits this, but both he and Grassmann translate the verse.
Grassmann: Durch stetes Opfer möcht ich euch gewinnen recht, Gebet, das zu euch Göttern drengt, empfangt ihr gern.
Ludwig: Bei jedem opfer ist zusammen mit euch der siegreich thätige, in jedem lied hat der fromme an euch gedacht.
Ludwig proposes to read âdîdhiye or devayâd â dîdhiye, but even then the construction remains difficult.
Note 1. Yagñâ´-yagñâ´, an adverbial expression, much the same as yagñe yagñe (I, 136, 1); it occurs once more in VI, 48, 1.
Note 2. Tuturvánih does occur here only, but is formed like gugurváni, I, 142, 8, and susukváni, VIII, 23, 5. Possibly tuturvanih might stand for the host of the Maruts in the singular, 'you hasten together to every sacrifice.' As to dadhidhve, used in a similar sense, see IV, 34, 3; 37, 1.
As a conjecture, though no more, I propose to read evayâh u.
Éva, in the sense of going, quick, is used of the horses of the Maruts, I, 166, 4. More frequently it has the sense of going, moving, than of manner (mos), and as an adverb eva and evam mean in this way (K. Z. II, 235). From this is derived evayâh, in the sense of quickly moving, an epithet applied to Vishnu, I, 156, 1, and to the Maruts, V, 41, 16: kathâ´ dâsema námasâ su-dâ´nûn eva-yâ´ marútah akkha-ukthaih, How shall we worship with praise and invocations the liberal quick-moving Maruts? I read, with Roth, eva-yâ´h; otherwise we should have to take evayâ as
p. 282
an adverbial instrumental, like âsayâ´ from âsâ; see Grassmann, s. v. âsayâ.
In one hymn (V, 87) Evayâ-marut, as one word, has become an invocation, reminding us of ἤιε Φοῖβε, or Evoe Bacche, and similar forms. Possibly ἤια may be viatica, though the vowels do not correspond regularly (see yayi, I, 87, 2, note 1).
From eva we have also eva-yâvan (fem. evayâ´varî, VI. 48, 12), which Benfey proposed to divide into evayâ-van, quick, again an epithet of Vishnu and the Maruts. If then we read evayâh u, without the accent on the last syllable, we should have a proper invocation of the Maruts, 'You, quick Maruts, accept prayer after prayer.'
Verse 2.
Note 1. Ísham svâ´r are joined again in VII, 66, 9. sahá ísham svâ´h ka dhîmahi. It seems to mean food and light, or water and light, water being considered as invigorating and supporting. Abhigâyanta governs the accusative.
Note 2. The meaning of spring was first assigned to vavra by Grassmann.
Note 3. Though I cannot find gâ´vah and ukshánah again, used in apposition to each other, I have little doubt that Grassmann is right in taking both as one word, like ταῦρος βοῦς in Greek.
Verse 3.
Note 1. The first line of this verse is extremely difficult. Grassmann translates:


Ludwig: Die wie Soma, das gepresst aus saftvollen stengel, aufgenommen ins innere freundlich weilen.
It may be that the Maruts are likened to Somas, because they refresh and strengthen. So we read VIII, 48, 9:
tvám hí nah tanvãh Soma gopâ´h gâ´tre-gâtre ni-sasáttha.
For thou, O Soma, has sat down as a guardian in every member of our body.
It is possible, therefore, though I shall say no more, that the poet wished to say that the Maruts, bringing rain and
p. 283
cooling the air, are like Somas in their refreshing and invigorating power, when stirring the hearts of men. In X, 78, 2, the Maruts are once more compared with Somas, su-sármânah ná sómâh ritám yaté. Should there be a dative hidden in â´sate?
Rambhinî I now take with Sâyana in the sense of a wife clinging to the shoulders of her husband, though what is meant is the spear, or some other weapon, slung over the shoulders; see I, 167, 3.
Verse 5.
Note 1. Hánvâ-iva gihváyâ gives no sense, if we take hanvâ as an instrum. sing. Hanu is generally used in the dual, in the Rig-veda always, meaning the two jaws or the two lips. Thus Ait. Br. VII, 11. hanû sagihve; AV. X, 2, 7. hanvor hi gihvâm adadhâh, he placed the tongue in the jaws. I should therefore prefer to read hanû iva, which would improve the metre also, or take hanvâ for a dual, as Sâyana does.
One might also translate, 'Who amongst you, O Maruts, moves by himself, as the jaws by the tongue,' but the simile would not be so perfect. The meaning is the same as in the preceding verse, viz. that the Maruts are self-born, self-determined, and that they move along without horses and chariots. In. X, 78, 2, the Maruts are called svayug, like the winds.
Note 2. I feel doubtful about dhanvakyút, and feel inclined towards Sâyana's explanation, who takes dhanvan for antariksha. It would then correspond to parvata-kyút, dhruva-kyút, &c.
Note 3. Purupraisha may also be, You who have the command of many.
Note 4. As to ahanyâ´h ná étasah, see V, 1, 4. svetáh vâgî´ gâyate ágre áhnâm.
Verse 6.
Vithura translated before, I, 87, 3, by broken, means also breakable or brittle. Sâyana explains it by grass, which may be true, though I see no authority for it. Grassmann translates it by leaves. It is derived from vyath.
p. 284
Verse 7.
Sâtí and râtí are used on purpose, the former meaning the acquisition or conquest of good things, the latter the giving away of them. The onslaught of the Maruts is first described as violent and crushing; their liberality in giving away what they have conquered, chiefly rain, is represented as delightful, like the gifts of a liberal worshipper. Then follows prithugráyî asuryẽva gáñgatî. Here asuryâ reminds us of the asuryâ in the preceding hymn, where it occurred as an epithet of Rodasî, the lightning. Prithugráyî, wide-spreading, seems to apply best to the rain, that is, the râti, though it might also apply to the lightning. However, the râti is the storm with rain and lightning, and I therefore propose to read gágghatî for gáñgatî. Gañg is a root which occurs here only, and gaggh too is a root which is unknown to most students of Sanskrit. Benfey a, to whom we owe so much, was the first to point out that gaggh, which Yâska explains by to make a noise and applies to murmuring waters, is a popular form of gaksh, to laugh, a reduplicated form of has. He shows that ksh is changed into kkh in akkhâ for akshâ, and into gh and ggh, in Pâli and Prakrit, e. g. ghâ for kshâ. The original form gaksh, to laugh, occurs I, 33, 7. tvám etâ´n rudatáh gákshatah ka áyodhayah, thou foughtest them, the crying and the laughing.
That the lightning is often represented as laughing we see from the very next verse, áva smayanta vidyútah, the lightnings laughed down; and the very fact that this idea occurs in the next verse confirms me in the view that it was in the poet's mind in the preceding one. See also I, 23, 12. haskârâ´t vidyútah pári átah gâtâ´h avantu nah marútah mrilayantu nah.
In the only other passage where gañg occurs, VIII, 43, 8, arkíshâ gañganâbhávan, applied to Agni, admits of the same correction, gagghanâbhávan, and of the same translation, 'laughing with splendour.'
Benfey's objection to the spelling of gaghgh with two

p. 285
aspirates is just with regard to pronunciation, but this would hardly justify our changing the style of our MSS., which, in this and in other cases, write the two aspirates, though intending them for non-aspirate and aspirate.
Verse 9.
Note 1. Prisni, the mother of the Maruts, who are often called Prisni-mâtarah, gó-mâtarah, and síndhu-mâtarah.
Note 2. As to svadhâ in the sense of food, see before, I, 6, 4, note 2, and X, 157, 5.
Note 3. Abhva is more than dark clouds, it is the dark gathering of clouds before a storm, ein Unwetter, or, if conceived as a masculine, as in I, 39, 8, ein Ungethüm. Such words are simply untranslatable.

19,"MANDALA I, HYMN 170.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 8-9.","Dialogue between Indra and his Worshipper, Agastya","1. Indra: There is no such thing to-day, nor will it be so to-morrow. Who knows what strange thing 1 this is? We must consult the thought of another, for even what we once knew seems to vanish.
2. Agastya: Why dost thou wish to kill us, O Indra? the Maruts are thy brothers; fare kindly with them, and do not strike 1 us in battle.
3. The Maruts: O brother Agastya, why, being a friend, dost thou despise us? We know quite well what thy mind was. Dost thou not wish to give to us?
4. Agastya: Let them prepare the altar, let them light the fire in front! Here we two will spread 2 for thee the sacrifice, to be seen 1 by the immortal.
5. Agastya: Thou rulest, O lord of treasures; thou, lord of friends, art the most generous. Indra, speak again with the Maruts, and then consume our offerings at the right season.
p. 287
NOTES.
Although this hymn is not directly addressed to the Maruts, yet as it refers to the before-mentioned rivalry between the Maruts and Indra, and as the author is supposed to be the same, namely Agastya, I give its translation here.
None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., TS., AV.
The Anukramanikâ ascribes verses 1, 3, 4 to Indra, 2 and 5 to Agastya; Ludwig assigns verses 1 and 3 to the Maruts, 2, 4, and 5 to Agastya; Grassmann gives verse 1 to Indra, 2 and 3 to the Maruts, and 4 and 5 to Agastya.
The hymn admits of several explanations. There was a sacrifice in which Indra and the Maruts were invoked together, and it is quite possible that our hymn may owe its origin to this. But it is possible also that the sacrifice may be the embodiment of the same ideas which were originally expressed in this and similar hymns, namely, that Indra, however powerful by himself; could not dispense with the assistance of the storm-gods. I prefer to take the latter view, but I do not consider the former so untenable as I did formerly. The idea that a great god like Indra did not like to be praised together with others is an old idea, and we find traces of it in the hymns themselves, e. g. II, 33, 4. mâ´ dúhstutî, mâ´ sáhûtî.
It is quite possible, therefore, that our hymn contains the libretto of a little ceremonial drama in which different choruses of priests are introduced as preparing a sacrifice for the Maruts and for Indra, and as trying to appease the great Indra, who is supposed to feel slighted. Possibly Indra and the Maruts too may have been actually represented by some actors, so that here, as elsewhere, the first seeds of the drama would be found in sacrificial performances.
I propose, though this can only be hypothetical, to take the first verse as a vehement complaint of Indra, when asked to share the sacrifice with the Maruts. In the second
p. 288
verse Agastya is introduced as trying to pacify Indra. The third verse is most likely an appeal of the Maruts to remind Indra that the sacrifice was originally intended for them. Verses 4 and 5 belong to Agastya, who, though frightened into obedience to Indra, still implores him to make his peace with the Maruts.
Verse 1.
Note 1. In the first verse Indra expresses his surprise in disconnected sentences, saying that such a thing has never happened before. I do not take ádbhuta (nie da gewesen) in the sense of future, because that is already contained in svas. The second line expresses that Indra does not remember such a thing, and must ask some one else, whether he remembers anything like it. We ought to take abhisamkarénya as one word, and probably in the sense of to be approached or to be accepted. Abhisamkârin, however, means also changeable.
Verse 2.
Note 1. Vadhîh is the augmentless indicative, not subjunctive; see, however, Delbrück, Synt. Forsch. I, pp. 21, 115.
Verse 4.
Note 1. Ketana refers to yagña as in VIII, 13, 8. It means that which attracts the attention of the gods (IV, 7, 2), and might be translated by beacon.
Note 2. The dual tanavâvahai is strange. It may refer, as Grassmann supposes, to Agastya and his wife, Lopamudrâ, but even that is very unusual. See Oldenberg, K. Z. XXXIX, 62. Professor Oldenberg (K. Z. XXXIX, 60 seq.) takes this and the next hymn as parts of the same Âkhyâna hymn, and as intimately connected with the Marutvatîya Sâstra of the midday Savana, in the Soma sacrifice.

The Anukramanî assigns verses 1 and 2 to the Maruts, the rest to Indra Marutvat. The poet is again Agastya. The whole hymn corresponds to the situation as described in the preceding hymns, and leads on to a kind of compromise between the Maruts, who seem really the favourite gods of the poet, and Indra, an irresistible and supreme deity whose claims cannot be disregarded.
None of the verses of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., TS., AV.
Verse 1.
Note 1. Sumati here means clearly favour, as in I, 73, 6, 7; while in I, 166, 6 it means equally clearly prayer.
Note 2. Ludwig takes rarânátâ as referring to sûkténa and námasâ. The accent of rarânátâ is irregular, and likewise the retaining of the final long â in the Pada text. Otherwise the form is perfectly regular, namely the 2 p. plural of the reduplicated aorist, or the so-called aorist of the causative a. Pânini (VII, 4, 2, 3) gives a number of verbs which form that aorist as  ̆  ̆  ̄, and not as  ̆  ̄  ̆ e. g. asasâsat, not asîsasat; ababâdhat, ayayâkat, &c. Some verbs may take both forms, e. g. abibhragat and ababhrâgat. This option applies to all Kânyâdi verbs, and one of these is ran, which therefore at the time of Kâtyâyana was supposed to have formed its reduplicated aorist both as árarânat and as árîranat. Without the augment we expect rî´ranata or rárânata. The question is why the final a should have been lengthened not only in the Samhitâ, that would be explicable, but in the Pada text also. The conjunctive of the perfect would be râránata. See also Delbrück, Verbum, p. 111.
Note 3. Vedyâbhis, which Ludwig translates here by um dessentwillen, was ihr erfaren sollt, I have translated by clearly, though tentatively only.

p. 291
Verse 2.
Note 1. The same idea is expressed in X, 47, 7. hridisprísah mánasâ vakyámânâh.
Note 2. Námasah vridhâ´sah is intended to convey the idea that the Maruts increase or bless those who worship them.
Verse 3.
Note 1. The second line has given rise to various interpretations.
Grassmann:


Ludwig: Hoch mögen sein unsere kämpfenden lanzen, alle tage, O Marut, sigesstreben.
As komyâ never occurs again, it must for the present be left unexplained.
There was another difficult passage, I, 88, 3. medhâ´ vánâ ná krinavante ûrdhvâ, which I translated, 'May the Maruts stir up our minds as they stir up the forests.' I pointed out there that ûrdhva means not only upright, but straight and strong (I, 172, 3; II, 30, 3), and I conjectured that the erect trees might have been used as a symbol of strength and triumph. Vana, however, may have been used poetically for anything made of wood, just as cow is used for leather or anything made of leather. In that case vana might be meant for the wooden walls of houses, or even for lances (like δούρατα from δόρυ = Sk. dâru), and the adjective would probably have to determine the true meaning. If connected with komala it might have the same meaning as εὐξεστός.
Prof. Oldenberg suggests that vanâni may be meant for the wooden vessels containing the Soma.
Verse 5.
Note 1. The Mânas are the people of Mânya, see I, 165, 15, note 1, and there is no necessity for taking mâna, with Grassmann, as a general name for poet (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xvi, p. 174).
p. 292
Note 2. It is doubtful to which word savasâ belongs.
I take it to be used adverbially with vyushtishu.
Verse 6.
Note 1. We might also translate, 'protect men from the stronger one,' as we read I, 120, 4. pâtám ka sáhyasah yuvám ka rábhyasah nah; and still more clearly in IV, 55, 1. sáhîyasah varuna mitra mártât. But I doubt whether nrîn by itself would be used in the sense of our men, while narah is a common name of the Maruts, whether as diváh nárah, I, 64, 4, or as nárah by themselves, I, 64, 10; 166, 13, &c.
Note 2. On the meaning of avayâ in ávayâtahelâh, see Introduction, p. xx.
Note 3. On dadhânah, see VIII, 97, 13, &c.

The hymn is ascribed to Agastya, the metre is Gâyatrî. None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., TS., AV.
Verse 1.
Prof. Oldenberg conjectures kitrâ´ ûtíh, and possibly mahibhânavah for ahibhânavah. See for yâ´mah kitráh ûtî´ V, 52, 2. té yâ´man pânti; also VI, 48, 9.

22,"MANDALA II, HYMN 34.","ASHTAKA II, ADHYÂYA 7, VARGA 19-21.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. The Maruts charged with rain 1, endowed with fierce force, terrible like wild beasts 2, blazing 3 in their strength 4, brilliant like fires, and impetuous 5, have uncovered the (rain-giving) cows by blowing away the cloud 6.
2. The (Maruts) with their rings 1 appeared like the heavens with their stars 2, they shone wide like streams from clouds as soon as Rudra, the strong man, was born for you, O golden-breasted Maruts, in the bright lap of Prisni 3.
3. They wash 1 their horses like racers in the courses, they hasten with the points of the reed 2 on their quick steeds. O golden jawed 3 Maruts, violently shaking (your jaws), you go quick 4 with your spotted deer 5, being friends of one mind.
4. Those Maruts have grown to feed 1 all these beings, or, it may be, (they have come) hither for the sake of a friend, they who always bring quickening rain. They have spotted horses, their bounties cannot be taken away, they are like headlong charioteers on their ways 2.
5. O Maruts, wielding your brilliant spears, come hither on smooth 1 roads with your fiery 2 cows (clouds) whose udders are swelling; (come hither), being of one mind, like swans toward their nests, to enjoy the sweet offering.
6. O one-minded Maruts, come to our prayers, come to our libations like (Indra) praised by men 1!
p. 296
[paragraph continues]
Fulfil (our prayer) like the udder of a barren cow 2, and make the prayer glorious by booty to the singer.
7. Grant us this strong horse for our chariot, a draught 1 that rouses our prayers, from day to day, food to the singers, and to the poet in our homesteads 2 luck 3, wisdom, inviolable and invincible strength.
8. When the gold-breasted Maruts harness the horses to their chariots, bounteous 1 in wealth, then it is as if a cow in the folds poured out 2 to her calf copious food, to every man who has offered libations.
9. Whatever mortal enemy may have placed us among wolves 1, shield us from hurt, ye Vasus! Turn the wheels with burning heat2 against him, and strike down the weapon of the impious fiend, O Rudras!
10. Your march, O Maruts, appears brilliant, whether even friends have milked the udder of Prisni, or whether, O sons of Rudra, you mean to blame him who praises you, and to weaken those who are weakening Trita, O unbeguiled heroes 1.
11. We invoke you, the great Maruts, the constant wanderers, at the offering of the rapid Vishnu 1; holding ladles (full of libations) and prayerful we ask the golden-coloured and exalted Maruts for glorious wealth.
12. The Dasagvas (Maruts?) 1 carried on 2 the sacrifice first; may they rouse us at the break of dawn. Like the dawn, they uncover the dark nights with the red (rays), the strong ones, with their brilliant light, as with a sea of milk.
13. With the (morning) clouds, as if with glittering red ornaments 1, these Maruts have grown great in the sacred places 2. Streaming down with rushing
p. 297
splendour 3, they have assumed their bright and brilliant colour.
14. Approaching 1 them for their great protection to help us, we invoke them with this worship, they whom Trita may bring near, like the five Hotri priests for victory 2, descending on their chariot to help.
15. May that grace of yours by which you help the wretched 1 across all anguish, and by which you deliver the worshipper from the reviler, come hither, O Maruts; may your favour approach us like a cow (going to her calf)!

NOTES.
Hymn ascribed to Gritsamada. Metre, 1-14 Gagatî, 15 Trishtubh, according to the paribhâshâ in the Sarvânukramanî 12, 13. See also Ludwig, III, p. 59; Bergaigne, Recherches sur l’histoire de la liturgie védique, 1889, pp. 66 seq.; Oldenberg, Prolegomena, p. 144. None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV. The first verse is found in TB. II, 5, 5, 4, with three various readings, viz. tavishébhir ûrmíbhih instead of távishîbhir arkínah, bhrúmim instead of bhrímim, and rípa instead of ápa.
Verse 1.
Note 1. Dhârâvarâ´h, a word of doubtful import, possibly meaning wishing for rain, or the suitors of the streams of rain. The Maruts are sometimes represented as varas or suitors; cf. V, 60, 4.
Note 2. Cf. II, 33, 11.
Note 3. Bergaigne, II, 381, translates arkínah by chantres, singers, deriving it, as it would seem, from arka which, as he maintains (Journ. Asiat. 1884, IV, pp. 194 seq.), means always song in the RV. (Rel. Véd. I, 279). This, however, is not the case, as has been well shown by Pischel, Ved. Stud. I, pp. 23 seq. Besides, unless we change arkinah into arkinah, we must connect it with arki, light. Thus we read VIII, 41, 8, arkínâ padâ´.
Note 4. Tavishébhir ûrmíbhih, the reading of the Taittirîyas, is explained by Sâyana by balavadbhir gamanaih. It may have been taken from RV. VI, 61, 2.
Note 5. On rigîshín, see I, 64, 125; I, 87, I.
Note 6. Bhrími seems to me a name of the cloud, driven about by the wind. The Taittirîyas read bhrúmim, and Sâyana explains it by megham dharnantas kâlayantah. In most passages, no doubt, bhrimi means quick, fresh, and is opposed to radhra, IV, 32, 2; VII, 56, 20. In I, 31, 16, as applied to Agni, it may mean quick. But in our passage that meaning is impossible, and I prefer the traditional
p. 299
meaning of cloud to that of storm-wind, adopted by Benfey and Roth. The expression 'to blow a storm-wind' is not usual, while dham is used in the sense of blowing away clouds and darkness. The cows would then be the waters in the clouds. It is possible, however, that Sâyana's explanation, according to which bhrimi is a musical instrument, may rest on some traditional authority. In this case it would correspond to dhámantah vânám, in I, 85, 102.
Verse 2.
Note 1. On khâdin, see I, 166, 9, note 2. On rukma-vakshas, I, 64, 4, note 1. Golden-breasted is meant for armed with golden chest-plates. The meaning seems to be that the Maruts with their brilliant khâdis appear like the heavens with their brilliant stars. The Maruts are not themselves lightning and rain, but they are seen in them, as Agni is not the fire, but present in the fire, or the god of fire. Thus we read, RV. III, 26, 6. agnéh bhâ´mam marútâm ógah, 'The splendour of Agni, the strength of the Maruts,' i. e. the lightning. It must be admitted, however, that a conjecture, proposed by Bollensen (Z. D. M. G. XLI, p. 501), would improve the verse. He proposes to read rishtayah instead of vrishtayah. We should then have to translate, 'Their spears shone like lightnings from the clouds.' These rishtis or spears are mentioned by the side of khâdi and rukma in RV. V, 54, 11, and the compound rishtívidyutah is applied to the Maruts in I, 168, 5 and V, 52, 13. The difficulty which remains is abhríyâh.
Note 2. On dyâ´vo ná stribhih, see note to I, 87, 1.
Note 3. The second line is full of difficulties. No doubt the Maruts are represented as the sons of Rudra (V, 60, 5; VI, 66, 3), and as the sons of Prisni, fem., being called Prísni-mâtarah. Their birth is sometimes spoken of as unknown (VII, 56, 2), but hardly as mysterious. Who knows their birth, hardly means more than 'the wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh.' Prisni as a feminine is the speckled sky, and the cloud may have been conceived
p. 300
as the udder at the same time that Prisni was conceived as a cow (I, 160, 3). Nothing seems therefore more natural than that we should translate, 'When Rudra had begotten you in the bright lap of Prisni.' The bright lap, sukrám û´dhah, is an idiomatic expression (VI, 66, 1; IV, 3, 10), and I see no reason why we should with Roth, K. Z. XXVI, 49, change the sukré of the padapâtha into sukráh and refer it to vríshâ.
The real difficulty lies in ágani. Can it mean he begot, as Bergaigne (Religion Védique, III, 35) interprets it? Wherever ágani occurs it means he was born, and I doubt whether it can mean anything else. It is easy to suggest aganît, for though the third person of the aorist never occurs in the RV., the other persons, such as aganishta, ganishthâh, are there. But, as the verse now stands, we must translate, 'When Rudra was born for you, he the strong one in the bright udder of Prisni.' Could Rudra be here conceived as the son, he who in other passages is represented as the husband of Prisni? There is another passage which may yield the same sense, VI, 66, 3. vidé hí mâtâ´ maháh mahî´ sâ´, sâ´ ít prísnih subhvẽ gárbham â´ adhât, 'for she, the great, is known as the mother of the great, that very Prisni conceived the germ (the Maruts) for the strong one.'
Verse 3.
Note 1. Ukshánte is explained by washing, cleaning the horses, before they start for a new race. See V, 59, I. ukshánte ásvân, followed by tárushante â´ rágah; IX, 109, 10. ásvah ná niktáh vâgî´ dhánâya; Satap. Br. XI, 5, 5, 13. Pischel (Ved. Stud. I, 189) supposes that it always refers to the washing after a race.
Note 2. Nadásya kárnaih is very difficult. Sâyana's explanation, meghasya madhyapradesaih, 'through the hollows of the cloud,' presupposes that nada by itself can in the RV. be used in the sense of cloud, and that karna, ear, may have the meaning of a hole or a passage. To take, as BR. propose, kárna in the sense of karná, eared, with long ears, would not help us much. Grassmann's
p. 301
translation, 'mit der Wolke schnellen Fittigen,' is based on a conjectural reading, nadasya parnaih. Ludwig's translation, 'mit des fluszes wellen den raschen eilen sie,' is ingenious, but too bold, for karna never means waves, nor nada river in the Rig-veda. The Vedârthayatna gives: 'they rush with steeds that make the roar,' taking karnaih for kartribhih, which again is simply impossible. The best explanation is that suggested by Pischel, Ved. Stud., p. 189. He takes nada for reed, and points out that whips were made of reeds. The karna would be the sharp point of the reed, most useful for a whip. I cannot, however, follow him in taking âsúbhih in the sense of accelerating. I think it refers to asva in the preceding pâda.
Note 3. Híranyasiprâh. Siprâ, in the dual sipre, is intended for the jaws, the upper and lower jaws, as in RV. I, 101, 10. ví syasva sípre, open the jaws. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 249, note. RV. III, 32, I; V, 36, 2, sipre and hánû; VIII, 76, 10); X, 96, 9. sípre hárinî dávidhvatah; X, 105, 5. síprâbhyâm siprínîvân. In the plural, however, siprâh, V, 54, 11 (síprâh sîrshásu vítatâh hiranyáyîh), VIII, 7, 25, is intended for something worn on the head, made of gold or gold threads. As we speak of the ears of a cap, that is, lappets which protect the ears, or of the cheeks of a machine, so in this case the jaws seem to have been intended for what protects the jaws, and not necessarily for the real jaw-bones of an animal; used as an helmet, and afterwards imitated in any kind of metal. As to siprin it may mean helmeted or possessed of jaws. To be possessed of jaws is no peculiar distinction, yet in several of the passages where siprin occurs, there is a clear reference to eating and drinking; see VI, 44, 14; VIII, 2, 28; 17, 4; 32, 24; 33, 7; 92, 4; see also sípravân in VI, 17, 2. It is possible therefore that like susipra, siprin also was used in the sense of possessed of jaw-bones, i. e. of strong jaw-bones. Even such epithets as híranya-sipra, hári-sipra, híri-sipra may mean possessed of golden, possibly of strong jaws. (M. M., Biographies of Words, p. 263, note.) Roth takes hárisipra as yellow-jawed, hírisipra as golden-cheeked, or with golden helmet, hiranyasipra, with golden
p. 302
helmet. A decision between golden-jawed or golden-helmeted is difficult, yet golden-jawed is applicable in all cases.
In our passage we must be guided by dávidhvatah, which together with sípra occurs again X, 96, 9. sípre vâ´gâya hárini dávidhvatah, shaking the golden jaws, and it seems best to translate: O ye golden-jawed Maruts, shaking (your jaws), you go to feed.
Note 4. If we retain the accent in prikshám, we shall have to take it as an adverb, from prikshá, quick, vigorous, like the German snël. This view is supported by Pischel, Ved. Stud. I, 96. If, however, we could change the accent into príksham, we might defend Sâyana's interpretation. We should have to take príksham as the accusative of priksh, corresponding to the dative prikshé in the next verse. Priksh is used together with subh, ish, ûrg (VI, 62, 4), and as we have subham yâ, we might take príksham yâ in the sense of going for food, in search of food. But it is better to take prikshám as an adverb. In the next verse prikshé is really a kind of infinitive, governing bhûvanâ.
Note 5. Tradition explains the Prishatîs as spotted deer, but prishadasva, as an epithet of the Maruts, need not mean having Prishatîs for their horses, but having spotted horses. See Bergaigne, Rel. Véd. II, p. 378, note.
Verse 4.
Note 1. Ludwig translates: Zu narung haben sie alle dise wesen gebracht; Grassmann: Zur Labung netzten alle diese Wesen sie. Ludwig suggests kitrâya for mitrâya; Oldenberg, far better, mitrâyávah, looking for friends, like mitrâyúvah, in I, 173, 10.
Note 2. On vayúna, see Pischel in Vedische Studien, p. 301. But why does Pischel translate rigipyá by bulls, referring to VI, 67, 11?
Verse 5.
Note 1. Adhvasmábhih seems to mean unimpeded or smooth. Cf. IX, 91, 3.
Note 2. The meaning of índhanvabhih is very doubtful.
p. 303
Verse 6.
Note 1. Narâ´m ná sámsah, the original form of Narâsamsah, I take here as a proper name, Männerlob (like Frauenlob, the poet) referring to Indra. Bergaigne, I, p. 305, doubts whether Narâsamsa can be a proper name in our passage, but on p. 308 he calls it an appellation of Indra.
Note 2. Ásvâm iva, gives a sense, but one quite inappropriate to the Veda. It would mean, 'fill the cow in her udder like a mare.' I therefore propose to read asvãm iva (asuam iva), from asû, a cow that is barren, or a cow that has not yet calved. Thus we read, I, 112, 3. yâ´bhih dhenúm asvãm pínvathah, 'with the same help with which you nourish a barren cow.' Cf. I, 116, 22. staryãm pipyathuh gâ´m, 'you have filled the barren cow.' If asvãm iva dhenúm is a simile, we want an object to which it refers, and this we find in dhíyam. Thus we read, V, 71, 2; VII, 94, 2; IX, 19, 2, pipyatam dhíyah, to fulfil prayers. I know, of course, that such changes in the sacred text will for the present seem most objectionable to my friends in India, but I doubt not that the time will come when they will see that such emendations are inevitable. I see that in the appendix to the Petersburg Dictionary, s. v. asû, the same conjecture has been suggested.
Verse 7.
Note 1. Here again I have taken great liberties. Âpânám is explained by Sâyana as a participle for âpnuvantam. This participle, though quite correct (see Lindner, Altindische Nominalbildung, p. 54), does not occur again in the RV., nor does it yield a proper meaning. It could only mean, 'give us a horse to the chariot, an obtaining prayer, rousing the attention (of the gods) day by day.' Âpâna may mean a drinking or carousing, and I do not see why we should not take it in that sense. Sacrifices in ancient times' were often festivals; VII, 22, 3. imâ´ bráhma sadhamâ´de gushasva, 'accept these prayers at our feast.' If we suppose that âpâna refers to the drinking of Soma, then
p. 304
nothing is more appropriate than to call the drinking kitáyat, exciting, bráhma, a hymn. Anyhow I can discover no better meaning in this line. Grassmann, who knows that kitayati means to excite, yet translates: 'Gebt Gebet, das durchdringt, euch erinnernd Tag für Tag.' Ludwig: 'Das erfolgreiche brahma, das erinnernde tag für tag.' Possibly we should have to change the accent from âpâná to âpâ´na. Âpâná in IX, 10, 5 is equally obscure.
Note 2. On vrigana, see I, 165, 153. For fuller discussions of the various meanings of vrigana, see Geldner, Ved. Stud. I, 139; Oldenberg, Göttinger gel. Anzeigen, 1890, pp. 410 seq.; Ph. Colinet, Les principes de l’exégèse védique d’après MM. Pischel et Geldner, p. 28; Ludwig, Über Methode bei Interpretation des Rig-veda, 1890, pp. 27 seq.
Note 3. Saní means acquiring, success, luck, gain, and is often placed in juxtaposition with medhâ´, wisdom. If they are thus placed side by side, sank looks almost like an adjective, meaning efficient. RV. I, 18, 6. saním medhâ´m ayâsisham, 'I had asked for efficient, true, real wisdom,' or, 'I had asked for success and wisdom.' In such passages, however, as V, 27, 4. dádat rikâ´ saním yaté dádat medhâ´m ritâyaté, it is clear that saní was considered as independent and different from medhâ´ (rikâyaté = ritâyaté).
Verse 8.
Note 1. On sudâ´navah, see note to I, 64, 6. It must often be left open whether sudâ´nu was understood as bounteous, or as having good rain or good Soma.
Note 2. Pinvate, lit. to make swell or abound.
Verse 9.
Note 1. Vrikatâ´ti is an old locative of vrikatât, wolf-hood. To place us in wolf hood means to treat us as wolves, or as vogelfrei. Others take it to mean treating us as a wolf would treat us.
Note 2. Tápushâ kakríyâ. According to Lanman (p. 571) tápushâ might be taken as an acc. dual fem. I know,
p. 305
however, of no strictly analogous cases, and prefer to take tápushâ as an instrumental, this being its usual employment.
Verse 10.
Note 1. The second line is obscure. Neither Grassmann nor Ludwig nor Sâyana can extract any intelligible meaning from it. I have translated it, but I am far from satisfied. There may be an antithesis between the friends (the Maruts themselves, see V, 53, 2), milking the udder of Prisni, and the Maruts coming to blame their friends for not offering them sacrifices, or for offering them sacrifices in common with Indra. In the first case when they, as friends, milk the cloud, their approach is brilliant and auspicious. In the second case, when they come to blame those who ought to celebrate them, or those who are actually hostile to them by causing the ruin or decay of a friend of the Maruts, such as Trita, their approach is likewise brilliant, but not auspicious. Trita is a friend of the Maruts whom they assist in battle, and it is possible that this legend may be alluded to here. Sometimes Trita seems also connected with the third libation which was offered at sunset, just as Vishnu represented the second libation which was offered at noon a. Thus we read, VIII, 12, 16. yát sómam indra víshnavi yát vâ gha trité âptyé yát vâ marútsu mándase, 'whether you, Indra, enjoy the Soma near Vishnu, or near Trita Âptya, or among the Maruts.' Sâkapûni, as quoted by Yâska (Nir. XII, 19), explains the three steps of Vishnu as earth, sky, and heaven; Aurnavâbha distinguishes Samârohana, Vishnupada, and Gayasiras. But all this does not help us to disentangle our verse. It should be added that Bergaigne makes Tritám to be governed by duhûh (Rel. Véd. II, 327). We should then have to translate, 'or whether they milk Trita in order to blame the singer, to make them old who make

p. 306
others old, or who themselves become old.' This, however, does not help us much. Professor Oldenberg conjectures that possibly guratâ´m might be changed to gurátâ´m, and that the dual of the verb might refer to Rudra and Prisni; or we might read gurátâ for guráta, if it refers to Rudriyas. Návamânasya might also be used in the sense of making a noise (see I, 29, 5), and possibly návamânasya nidé might have been intended for shouting and laughing to scorn. But all this leaves the true meaning of the verse as unfathomable as ever.
Verse 11.
Note 1. Víshnor eshásya prabhrithé is obscure. At the offering of the rapid Vishnu is supposed to mean, when the rapid Vishnu offers Soma. The same phrase occurs again, VII, 40, 5. In VIII, 20, 3, we can translate, 'we know the strength of the Maruts, and of the hasting Vishnu, the bounteous gods.' In VII, 39, 5, the reading is víshnum eshâm. Bergaigne (II, 419) is inclined to take vishnu esha as Soma. We should then translate, 'at the offering of Soma.'
Verse 12.
Note 1. The Dasagvas are mentioned as an old priestly family, like the Aṅgiras, and they seem also, like the Aṅgiras, to have their prototypes or their ancestors among the divine hosts. Could they here be identified with the Maruts? They are said to have been the first to carry on the sacrifice, and they are asked to rouse men at the break of the day. Now the same may be said of the Maruts. They are often connected with the dawn, probably because the storms break forth with greater vigour in the morning, or, it may be, because the chasing away of the darkness of the night recalls the struggle between the darkness of the thunderstorm and the brightness of the sun. The matutinal character of the Maruts appears, for instance, in V, 53, 14 (usrí bheshagám), and their father Dyaus is likewise called vrishabháh usríyah, V, 58, 6. In the second line ûrnute, though in the singular, refers also to the Maruts in the plural; see Bergaigne, Mélanges Renier,
p. 307
[paragraph continues]
Paris, 1886, p. 80. There still remain two difficult words, manáh and gó-arnasâ. The former (see Lanman, p. 501) may be taken as an adjective referring to the Dasagvas or Maruts, unless we take it as an adverb, quickly, like makshu. If we could change it into mahâ´, it would form an appropriate adjective to gyotishâ, as in IV, 50, 4. On gó-arnasâ all that can be said is that it mostly occurs where something is uncovered or revealed, so I, 112, 18; X, 38, 2.
Note 2. On yagñam vah, to carry on the sacrifice like a wagon, see Bergaigne, Rel. Véd. II, 259-260. See also RV. VIII, 26, 15; 58, 1, and yagña-vâhas.
Verse 13.
Note 1. In interpreting this obscure verse we must begin with what is clear. The arunâ´h añgáyah are the well-known ornaments of the Maruts, mentioned I, 37, 2, note; I, 64, 4, note, &c. The Maruts shine in these ornaments or paints, I, 85, 3; 87, 1; V, 56, 1; X, 78, 7. Though we do not know their special character, we know that, like the daggers, spears, and bracelets of the Maruts, they were supposed to contribute to their beautiful appearance. Again, we know that when the Maruts are said to grow (vavridhuh), that means that they grow in strength, in spirits, and in splendour, or, in a physical sense, that the storms increase, that the thunder roars, and the lightnings flash, see V, 55, 3; 59, 5. Now if it is said that the Rudras grew with kshonîs, as if with bright red ornaments, we must have in these kshonîs the physical prototype of what are metaphorically called their glittering ornaments. And here we can only think either of the bright morning clouds (referring to ushâ´h ná râmî´h arunaíh ápa ûrnute in the preceding verse), or lightnings. These bright clouds of heaven are sometimes conceived as the mothers (III, 9, 2. apáh mâtrî´h), and more especially the mothers of the Maruts, who are in consequence called Síndhu-mâtarah, X, 78, 6, a name elsewhere given to Soma, IX, 61, 7, and to the Asvins, I, 46, 2. It is said of a well-known hero, Purûravas (originally a solar hero), that as soon as he was born the women (gnâh) were there, and immediately afterwards
p. 308
that the rivers increased or cherished him, X, 95, 7. In other passages too these celestial rivers or waters or clouds are represented as women, whether mothers or wives (X, 124, 7). A number of names are given to these beings, when introduced as the companions of the Apsaras Urvasî, and it is said of them that they carne along like añgáyah arunáyah, like bright red ornaments, X, 95, 6. It seems clear therefore that the arunâ´h añgáyah of the Maruts have to be explained by the bright red clouds of the morning, or in more mythological language, by the Apsaras, who are said to be like arunáyah añgáyah. Hence, whatever its etymology may have been, kshonî´bhih in our passage must refer to the clouds of heaven, and the verse can only be translated, 'the Rudras grew with the clouds as with their red ornaments,' that is, the clouds were their red ornaments, and as the clouds grew in splendour, the Maruts grew with their splendid ornaments.
Professor Geldner arrived at a similar conclusion. In Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XI, p. 327, and more recently in Ved. Stud., p. 277, he assigned to kshonî the meaning of woman, which is quite possible, and would make it a synonym of the celestial gnâs. But he translates, 'the Maruts excite themselves with red colours as with women.' These are hardly Vedic thoughts, and the position of ná would remain anomalous. Nor should we gain much if we read to kshonayah arunebhih na añgibhih, 'these Rudras were delighted like wives by bright ornaments.' The bright ornaments have once for all a settled meaning, they are peculiar to the Maruts, and cannot in a Marut hymn be taken in any other sense.
Then comes the question, how is the meaning assigned to kshonî, namely cloud, or, as personified, Apsaras, applicable to other passages? In X, 95, 9, it seems most appropriate: 'So long as the mortal (Purûravas), longing for the immortal (Apsaras), does not come near with strength to those kshonîs, i. e. those Apsaras, or morning clouds, they beautified their bodies like ducks' (an excellent image, if one watches ducks cleaning themselves in the water), 'like sporting horses biting each other.' Geldner
p. 309
translates this verse somewhat differently, Ved. Stud. I, p. 276.
Having disposed of these two passages where kshonî occurs in the plural, we have next to consider those where it stands in the dual. Here kshonî always means heaven and earth, like rodasî, dyâvâprithivî, &c.
VIII, 7, 22. sám u tyé mahatî´h apáh sám kshonî´ sám u sû´ryam … parvasáh dadhuh. They, the Maruts, set the great waters (the sky), heaven and earth and the sun piecemeal (or, they put them together piece by piece).
VIII, 52, 10. sám índrah râ´yah brihatî´h adhûnuta sám kshonî´ sám u sû´ryam. Indra shook the great treasures, heaven and earth, and the sun.
VIII, 99, 6. ánu te súshmam turáyantam îyatuh kshonî´ sísum ná mâtárâ. Heaven and earth followed thy rapid strength, like mother-cows their calf.
II, 16, 3. ná kshonî´bhyâm paribhvẽ te indriyám. Thy strength is not to be compassed by heaven and earth.
If after this we look at the passage translated by Professor Geldner, I, 180, 5. apáh kshonî´ sakate mâ´hinâ vâm, we see at once that apáh and kshonî´ cannot be separated, and that we must translate, your Mâhinâ reaches heaven and earth and the sky. Mâhinâ, according to Professor Geldner, means the magnificent woman, namely Sûryâ, but it is possible that it may have been meant for 'mahimâ, your greatness reaches heaven and earth and the sky.' Apáh, which Professor Geldner translates 'from the water,' is the acc. plural, meaning the waters between heaven and earth, or the sky. It occurs again in connection with heaven and earth, the sun, heaven, and generally without any copula. Thus, VIII, 7, 22. apáh, kshonî´, sû´ryam, i. e. the waters (the sky), heaven and earth, the sun. I, 36, 8. ródasî apáh, heaven and earth and the waters; cf. V, 31, 6. Likewise I, 52, 12. apáh svãh paribhû´h eshi â´ dívam; V, 14, 4. ávindat gâ´h apáh svãh; VI, 47, 14. apáh gâ´h; cf. VI, 60, 2. VII, 44, 1. dyâ´vâprithivî´ apáh svãh, cf. X, 36, 1; IX. 90, 4; 91, 6.
There remain five passages where kshonîh occurs, and where Professor Geldner's conjecture that it means women
p. 310
holds good. In I, 54, 1, it may mean real women, or the women of the clouds. In I, 57, 4; 173, 7; VIII, 3, 10; 13, 17; also in X, 22, 9, women seems the most plausible translation.
Note 2. Rítasya sádanâni is almost impossible to translate. It may be the places in heaven where the Maruts are supposed to be, or the places where sacrifices are offered to them.
Note 3. Átyena pâ´gasâ has been explained in different ways. Sâyana renders it by always moving power; Grassmann by 'mit schnell erregtem Schimmer;' Ludwig, 'mit eilender kraft,' though he is no longer satisfied with this meaning, and suggests 'net for catching.' Roth has touched several times on this word. In the Allgemeine Monatsschrift of 1851, p. 87, he suggested for pâ´gas the meaning of 'impression of a foot or of a carriage, perhaps also reflection.' In his Notes on the Nirukta, p. 78 seq., he is very hard on the Indian commentators who explain the word by strength, but who never go conscientiously through all the passages in which a word occurs. He then still maintained that the word ought to be translated by track.
It seems, however, that the most appropriate meaning in the passages in which pâ´gas occurs is splendour, though of course a stream of light may be conceived as a bright train or path. In some the meaning of light seems quite inevitable, for instance, III, 15, I. ví pâ´gasâ prithúnâ sósukânah. Agni, shining with broad light.
VIII, 46, 25. â´ … yâhí makhâ´ya pâ´gase. Come hither, Vâyu, for strong light.
III, 14, 1. (agníh) prithivyâ´m pâ´gah asret. Agni assumed (or spread) splendour on earth.
VII, 10, 1. usháh ná gâráh prithú pâ´gah asret. (Agni,) like the lover of the dawn, assumed (or spread) wide splendour.
III, 61, 5. ûrdhvám madhudhâ´ diví pâ´gah asret. The dawn assumed rising splendour in the sky.
VII, 3, 4. ví yásya te prithivyâ´m pâ´gah ásret. Thou (Agni) whose splendour spread on earth.
p. 311
IX, 68, 3. abhivrágan ákshitam pâ´gah â´ dade. (Soma) approaching assumed imperishable splendour. This splendour of Soma is also mentioned in IX, 109, 21, and the expression that he shakes his splendour (vríthâ kar) occurs IX, 76, 1; 88, 5. (Cf. Geldner, Ved. Stud. I, p. 117.)
In VI, 21, 7. abhí tvâ pâ´gah rakshásah ví tasthe, it would, no doubt, seem preferable to translate, 'the power of the Rakshas came upon thee,' but the ugrám pâ´gah, the fierce light, is not out of place either, while in most of the passages which we have examined, the meaning of power would be entirely out of place.
In I, 121, 11, heaven and earth seem to be called pâ´gasî, the two splendours. Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 87, translates átyena pâ´gasâ by 'durch das stattliche Ross,' namely the Soma, but pâ´gas seems to be something that belongs to Soma, not Soma himself.
Verse 14.
Note 1. Grassmann suggests iyânâ´h instead of iyânáh.
Note 2. Abhíshtaye, for superiority or victory, rather than for assistance. Abhishtí, with accent on the last syllable, means conqueror or victorious; see RV. I, 9, 1; III, 34, 4; X, 100, 12; 104, 10.
Verse 15.
Note 1. On radhra and its various applications, see Pischel, Ved. Stud. I, p. 124.
"
23,"MANDALA V, HYMN 52.","ASHTAKA IV, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 8-10.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. O Syâvâsva, sing boldly with 1 the Maruts, the singers who, worthy themselves of sacrifice, rejoice in their guileless glory 2 according to their nature.
2. They are indeed boldly the friends of strong power; they on their march protect all who by themselves are full of daring 1.
3. Like rushing bulls, these Maruts spring over 1 the dark cows (the clouds) 2, and then we perceive the might of the Maruts in heaven and on earth.
4. Let us boldly offer praise and sacrifice to your Maruts, to all them who protect the generation of men, who protect the mortal from injury.
5. They who are worthy, bounteous, men of perfect strength, to those heavenly Maruts who are worthy of sacrifice, praise the sacrifice!
6. The tall men 1, coming near with their bright chains, and their weapon, have hurled forth their spears. Behind these Maruts there came by itself the splendour of heaven, like laughing lightnings 2.
7. Those who have grown up on earth, or in the wide sky, or in the realm of the rivers, or in the abode of the great heaven,
8. Praise that host of the Maruts, endowed with true strength and boldness 1, whether those rushing heroes have by themselves harnessed (their horses) for triumph,
9. Or whether these brilliant Maruts have in the (speckled) cloud clothed themselves in wool 1, or
p. 313
whether by their strength they cut the mountain asunder with the tire of their chariot;
10. Call them comers, or goers, or enterers, or followers, under all these names, they watch on the straw 1 for my sacrifice.
11. The men (the Maruts) watch, and their steeds watch. Then, so brilliant are their forms to be seen, that people say, Look at the strangers 1!
12. In measured steps 1 and wildly shouting 2 the gleemen 3 have danced toward the well (the cloud). They who appeared one by one like thieves, were helpers to me to see the light 4.
13. Worship, therefore, O seer, that host of Maruts, and keep and delight them with your voice, they who are themselves wise 1 poets, tall heroes armed with lightning-spears.
14. Approach, O seer, the host of Maruts, as a woman approaches a friend, for a gift 1; and you, Maruts, bold in your strength 2, hasten hither, even from heaven, when you have been praised by our hymns.
15. If he, after perceiving them, has approached them as gods with an offering, then may he for a gift remain united with the brilliant (Maruts), who by their ornaments are glorious on their march.
16. They, the wise 1 Maruts, the lords, who, when there was inquiry for their kindred, told me of the cow, they told me of Prisni as their mother, and of the strong Rudra as their father.
17. The seven and seven heroes 1 gave me each a hundred. On the Yamunâ I clear off glorious wealth in cows, I clear wealth in horses.

NOTES.
This hymn is ascribed to Syâvâsva Âtreya. Metre, Anushtubh, 1-5, 7-15; Paṅkti, 6, 16, and 17. Sâyana seems to take verse 16 as an Anushtubh, which of course is a mistake. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., TS., TB., MS., AV.
Verse 1.
Note 1. One expects the dative or accusative after arka. The instrumental leaves us no choice but to translate, 'Sing with the Maruts, who are themselves famous as singers.' Cf. I, 6, 8; V, 60, 8.
Note 2. On srávah mádanti, see Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 75.
Verse 2.
Note 1. Dhrishadvínas may also refer to the Maruts.
Verse 3.
Note 1. One expects ádhi instead of áti, see Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 95 seq.
Note 2. See note to I, 37, 5; also, Bartholomae in Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XV, 211. The whole verse has been discussed by Benfey, Vedica und Verwandtes, p. 152 seq.
Verse 6.
Note 1. This verse has been discussed before, I, 168, 7, note. Benfey (Nachrichten der K. Ges. der Wiss. zu Göttingen, 1876, 28 Juni; comp. Vedica und Verwandtes, p. 141) translated it: 'Heran … haben die Helden, die hehren, ihre Speere geschleudert; ihnen, den Maruts, nach (erheben sich) traun gleichsam lachende Blitze, erhebt sich selbst des Himmels Glanz.' Rishvâ´h seems here, as in verse 13, to refer to the Maruts, as in IV, 19, I, rishvám refers to Indra, though it can be used of weapons also, see VI, 18, 10. As to the instrumentalis comitativus in rukmaíh and yudhâ´, see Lanman, p. 335.
p. 315
Note 2. Benfey's explanation of gághghatîh is ingenious, though it leaves some difficulties. The writing of ghgh in Devanâgarî may have been meant for ggh, as in akhkhalîkrítya, VII, 103. 3. But there remains the fact that gaksh occurs in the sense of laughing, I, 33, 7, and one does not see why it should have undergone a Prakritic change in our passage, and not there. It might be a mimetic word, to express the sound of rattling and clattering; cf. gañganâbhávan, VIII, 43, 8.
Verse 8.
Note 1. As to the adjective in the masculine gender after sárdhas, see I, 37, 1, note. The meaning of ríbhvas, bold, rabid, is doubtful; see Bergaigne, Rel. Véd. II, 408.
Verse 9.
Note 1. Sâyana takes Parushnî as the name of one of the rivers of the Punjâb, called the Irâvatî, and at present the Ravi. Parushnî might mean speckled, muddy, as a synonym of prisni. Roth has suggested that parushnî might here mean cloud. But what is the meaning of parushnî in a similar passage, IV, 22, 2. (Índrah) sriyé párushnîm ushámânah–û´rnâm yásyâh párvâni sakhyâ´ya vivyé? If it means that Indra clothed himself in speckled wool, that wool might be intended for what we call woolly or fleecy clouds. As the Maruts often perform the same acts as Indra, we might read in our verse utá sma té párushnîs û´rnâh, and pronounce utá sma té párushnia û´rnâh, though Lanman, p. 395, objects to ias for îs in the acc. plur. See, however, hetî´h ádevîh in VIII, 61, 16. The instrumental singular is possible, but again unusual with vas, párushnyâ û´rnâ. Possibly the original meaning of parushnî may have been forgotten, and if the name of the river Parushnî was generally known, it might easily have taken the place of parushnî, the cloud. For other explanations see Roth, Über gewisse Kürzungen, Wien, 1887; Bartholomae, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXIX, 583; Schmidt, Die Pluralbildungen der indogermanischen Neutra, 1889, p. 307.
p. 316
Verse 10.
Note 1. Vishtâráh does not occur again, and Lanman is therefore quite justified in assigning to it the meaning of straw (p. 339). He paraphrases: 'Let their customs carry them where they may, yet when I sacrifice, they wait quietly on the straw, i. e. the altar, for it.' He reads in the Pada text vi-stâré for vi-stâráh. Vishtârín, which occurs AV. IV, 34, 1, does not throw much light on the exact meaning of vishtâra in this place. If we retain Vishtâráh, the nominative, we must assign to it the meaning of crowd, and refer it to the Maruts.
Verse 11.
Note 1. Pârâvata is a turtle-dove (VS. XXIV, 25), and it is just possible that the Maruts might have been compared to them. But pârâvata is used in VIII, 100, 6, as an epithet of vasu, wealth, and in VIII, 34, 18, we read of râtis (not râtris), i. e. gifts of Pârâvata. The river Sarasvatî is called pârâvataghnî, killing Pârâvata, VI, 61, 2, and in the Pañkav. Br. IX, 4, 1I, we hear that Turasravas and the Pârâvatas offered their Somas together. I am therefore inclined to take Pârâvata, lit. distant people, extranei, strangers, as a name of an Aryan border clan with whom the Vedic Aryas were sometimes at war, sometimes at peace. In that case the frontier-river, the Sarasvatî, might be called the destroyer or enemy of the Pârâvatas. As their wealth and gifts have been mentioned, to compare the Maruts with the Pârâvatas may mean no more than that the Maruts also are rich and generous. Ludwig thinks of the Παρυῆται, which seems more doubtful. For a different interpretation see Delbrück, Syntax, p. 531.
Verse 12.
Note 1. I take khandahstúbh in the sense of stepping (according to) a measure, as explained in my Preface (1st ed.), p. cii, though I do not doubt that that meaning was afterwards forgotten, and replaced by the technical meaning of stubh, to shout. See Böhtlingk-Roth, s. v. stubh, and
p. 317
stobhagrantha, Sâma-veda, Bibl. Ind., II, p. 519. It can hardly be supposed that such artificial performances of Vedic hymns, as are preserved in the Sâma-veda, could have suggested the first names of the ancient metres.
Note 2. Kubhanyú can only be derived from bhan, to shout.
Note 3. The kîrínah are probably intended here for strolling minstrels who, when they approached the well of a village (here the cloud), might be taken either for friends or foes.
Note 4. Drisí tvishé. Grassmann translates: 'Wie Räuberbanden schienen sie geschart zum Andrang meinem Blick.' Ludwig better: 'Helfer waren sie, glanz zu sehn.' We must either read drisé tvishé, to see the light, or drisé tvishí, to be seen by light. See, however, P. G., Ved. Stud. p. 225.
Verse 13.
Note 1. Vedhas, wise. The different possible meanings of this word have been discussed by Ludwig, Z. D. M. G. XL, p. 716; and by Bartholomae, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVII, p. 361.
Verse 14.
Note 1. On dânâ´, see Lanman, pp. 533, 335; P. G., Ved. Stud. p. 101.
Note 2. Dhrishnavah ógasâ to be read   ̄  ̆  ̄  ̆  ̄.
Verse 15.
This verse, as Roth says, is very obscure, and the translation is purely tentative. Grassmann derives vakshánâ from vah in the sense of an offering. It may more easily be derived from vaksh, i. e. what gives increase, and be taken as an instrumental. Pischel shows that in many passages vakshanâ in the plural has the meaning of yoni, also of the yoni on the altar. But even this meaning does not throw much light on our passage. The first pâda may possibly be taken in an interrogative and conditional sense, or we may translate: 'Now, having perceived them, may he, as a refreshing draught goes to the gods, come
p. 318
together with the Maruts for his reward.' Whatever the verse may mean, eshâm devâ´n cannot mean the gods of the Maruts, or prove the existence of idols, as Bollensen (Z. D. M. G. XXII, 587) and even Muir (S. T. V, 454) imagined. The translation of Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 101, sûríbhih añgíbhih mit 'Herren, die schmieren, d. h. ordentlich bezahlen,' seems too exclusively German. Could añgin be an adjective, in the sense of possessed of añgis?
Verse 16.
Note 1. If síkvas is not to be derived from sak (see Hübschmann, Vocalsystem, pp. 64, 186), we should have to derive nis, night, from a root altogether different from that which yields nakt, nákta, &c. But how does síkvas come to mean, according to Ludwig, both bunch of flowers, and flaming? Does he connect it with sikhâ? Surely, if siksh may stand for sisak-s, why not sik-vas for *sisakvas? 'Bright' leaves it doubtful whether it means clever or flaming.
Verse 17.
Note 1. The seven, seven heroes need not be the Maruts, but some liberal patrons who rewarded Syâvâsva. See Bergaigne, Rel. Véd. II, 371.

"
24,"MANDALA V, HYMN 53.","ASHTAKA IV, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 11-13.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. Who knows their birth? or who was of yore in the favour of the Maruts, when they harnessed the spotted deer 1?
2. Who has heard them when they had mounted their chariots, how they went forth? For the sake of what liberal giver (Sudâs) did they run, and their comrades followed 1, (as) streams of rain (filled) with food?
3. They themselves said to me when day by day 1 they came to the feast with their birds 2: they (the Maruts) are manly youths and blameless; seeing them, praise them thus;
4. They who shine by themselves in their ornaments 1, their daggers, their garlands, their golden chains, their rings, going 2 on their chariots and on dry land.
5. O Maruts, givers of quickening rain, I am made to rejoice, following after your chariots, as after days 1 going with rain.
6. The bucket which the bounteous heroes shook down from heaven for their worshipper, that cloud they send 1 along heaven and earth, and showers follow on the dry land.
7. The rivers having pierced 1 the air with a rush of water, went forth like milk-cows; when your spotted deer roll about 2 like horses that have hasted to the resting-place on their road.

9. Let not the Rasâ, the Anitabhâ, the Kubhâ, the Krumu, let not the Sindhu delay you! Let not the marshy Sarayu prevent you! May your favour be with us alone!
10. The showers come forth after the host of your chariots, after the terrible Marut-host of the ever-youthful heroes 1.
11. Let us then follow with our praises and our prayers each host of yours, each troop, each company 1.
12. To what well-born generous worshipper have the Maruts gone to-day on that march,
13. On which you bring to kith and kin the never-failing seed of corn? Give us that for which we ask you, wealth and everlasting happiness!
14. Let us safely pass through our revilers, leaving behind the unspeakable and the enemies. Let us be with you when in the morning 1 you shower down health, wealth 2, water, and medicine, O Maruts!
15. That mortal, O men, O Maruts, whom you protect, may well be always beloved by the gods, and rich in valiant offspring. May we be such!

Ascribed to Syâvâsva Âtreya. Metre, 1, 5, 10, 11, 15 Kakubh; 2 Brihatî; 3 Anushtubh; 4 Pura-ushnih; 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 16 Satobrihatî; 8, 12 Gâyatrî. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV.; the sixth verse is found in TS. II, 4, 8, 1; MS. II, 4, 7; Kâthaka XI, 9.
Verse 1.
Note 1. Kilâsî, as fem. of kilâsa, does not occur again. It seems to have meant spotted or marked with pocks, and would be intended for the príshatîs. Does Kailâsa come from the same source?
Verse 2.
Note 1. Kásmai sasruh is much the same as kásmai adyá súgâtâya … prá yayuh, in verse 12. We must then begin a new sentence, ánu âpáyah, their comrades after, namely sasruh. Thus we read in verse 10 tám yah sárdham … ánu prá yanti vrishtáyah, where the streams of rain are represented as the followers of the Maruts. We might also translate in our sentence: For what liberal giver did their comrades, the streams of rain with food follow after (the Maruts).
Verse 3.
Note 1. Úpa dyúbhih occurs again VIII, 40, 8, and seems to mean from day to day.
Note 2. The birds of the Maruts, probably of the same character as the birds of the Asvins.
Verse 4.
Note 1. I translate añgi by ornament in general, not by paint or ointment,. though that may have been its original meaning.
Note 2. On srâya, see Pân. III, 3, 24. Dhánvasu may possibly have been intended as governed by svábhânavah, and not by srâyâ´h; see, however, VIII, 33, 6. smásrushu sritáh.
p. 322
Verse 5.
Note 1. On dyâ´vah, nom. plur., and ráthân, acc. plur., compare Bergaigne, Mélanges Renier, p. 88. The text is doubtful, and may be a corruption of vrishtî´h dyâ´vah yatî´h iva.
Verse 6.
Note 1. The Taittirîyas, TS. II, 4, 8, 1, read pargányâh; the Maitreyas, prá pargányah srigatâm and yantu.
Verse 7.
Note 1. Tatridâná, as trid occurs in the Veda in the Parasmaipada only, may be intended for a passive, bored, dug out, tapped. One would, however, expect in that case an instrumental, marudbhih, by whom they were brought forth.
Note 2. The words ví yád vártanta enyãh have received various explanations. Wilson translates: 'When the rivers rush in various directions.' Sâyana admits also another meaning: 'When the rivers grow.' Ludwig translates: 'Sich verteilend gehn die schimmernden auszeinander.' Grassmann, very boldly: 'Wie Hengste träufelnd, wenn vom Wege heimgekehrt, sie zu den bunten Stuten gehn.' Vi-vrit seems, however, to have a very special meaning, namely, rolling on the ground, and this the spotted deer are here said to have done, like horses at the end of their journey. We read of the sacrificial horse, Sat. Br. XIII, 5, 1, 16. sa yady ava vâ gighred vi vâ varteta, samriddho me yagña iti ha vidyât; cf. XI, 2, 5, 3. In the TS. VII, I, 19, 3, the commentator explains vivartanam by nirgatya bhûmau vilunthanam, the rolling on the ground. The same meaning is applicable to Mahâparinibbâna Sutta, p. 66 (Childers), where the Bhikkhus are said to roll on the ground when they hear of Buddha's death; also to Mahâbh. III, 11953 (of a wild boar). The meaning therefore in our passage seems to be, when the deer roll on the ground, as horses are wont to do at the end of a journey.
Verse 8.
Note 1. Amâ´t corresponds here to prithivi in other places. Originally it may have meant from the home.
p. 323
Verse 9.
This verse has often been discussed on account of the names of the rivers which it contains. Syâvâsva had mentioned the Yamunâ in 52, 17, and some interpreters have been inclined to give to parushnî in 52, 9 a geographical meaning, taking it for the river Ravi, instead of translating it by cloud. The geographical names are certainly interesting, but they have been discussed so often that I need not dwell on them here. (See M. M., India. p. 163.)
The Rasâ, known to the Zoroastrians as the Ranhâ, was originally the name of a real river, but when the Âryas moved away from it into the Punjâb, it assumed a mythical character, and became a kind of Okeanos, surrounding the extreme limits of the world.
Anitabhâ seems to be the name of a new river or part of a river. It can hardly be taken as an epithet of Rasâ, as Ludwig suggests. Anitabhâ, whose splendour has not departed (Ludwig), or, amitabhâ, of endless splendour, would hardly be Vedic formations. (Chips, I, p. 157; Hibbert Lect., p. 207; India, pp. 166, 173, notes.)
Kubhâ is the Κωφήν or Κωφής of the Greeks, the Kabul river. The Krumu I take to be the Kurrum. (India, p. 177, note.)
The Sindhu is the Indus, though it is difficult to say which part of it, while the Sarayu has been supposed to be the Sarayû, the affluent of the Gaṅgâ, but may also be a more general name for some more northern river in the Punjâb. (See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, pp. 17 f., 45; Muir, S. T. II, p. xxv, note.)
Verse 10.
Note 1. Návyasînâm has been a puzzle to all interpreters. Sâyana seems to me to give the right interpretation, namely, nûtanânâm. As from añgasâ, instr. sing., straightway, añgasî´na was formed, straightforward; from návyasâ, instr. sing., anew, návyasîna seems to have been formed in the sense of new. Návyasînâm might then be a somewhat
p. 324
irregular gen. plur., referring to ganám mâ´rutam, the Marut-host of the young men; see V, 58, 1. Lanman (p. 515) takes it for a gen. plur. fem., but in that case it could not refer to ráthânâm. Zimmer translates endlos, Bergaigne (II, 400) thinks of new or rejuvenescent mothers.
Verse 11.
Note 1. See III, 26, 6.
Verse 14.
Note 1. Usrí, in the morning. Lanman (p. 427) proposes to read ushári, but the metre would be better preserved by reading vrishtvî´ as trisyllabic. The difficulty is the construction of the gerund vrishtvî´, which refers to the Maruts, and syâ´ma sahá, which refers to the sacrificers.
Note 2. On sám yóh, see I, 165, 4, note 2.
The metrical structure of this hymn is interesting. If we represent the foot of eight syllables by a, that of twelve by b, we find the following succession:
We find that I contains the question, II the answer, III description of rain, IV prayer and invitation, V praise of the companions, VI prayer, VII conclusion. Comp. Oldenberg's Prolegomena, p. 106 seq.

"
25,"MANDALA V, HYMN 54.","ASHTAKA IV, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 14-16.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. You have fashioned 1 this speech for the brilliant Marut-host which shakes the mountains: celebrate then the great manhood in honour of that host who praises the warm milk (of the sacrifice), and sacrifices on the height of heaven 2, whose glory is brilliant.
2. O Maruts, your powerful men (came) forth searching for water, invigorating, harnessing their horses, swarming around. When they aim with the lightning, Trita shouts, and the waters murmur, running around on their course.
3. These Maruts are men brilliant with lightning, they shoot with thunderbolts, they blaze with the wind, they shake the mountains, and suddenly, when wishing to give water 1, they whirl the hail; they have thundering strength, they are robust, they are ever-powerful.
4. When you drive forth 1 the nights, O Rudras, the days, O powerful men, the sky, the mists, ye shakers, the plains, like ships, and the strongholds, O Maruts, you suffer nowhere.
5. That strength of yours, O Maruts, that greatness extended far as the sun extends its daily course, when you, like your deer on their march, went down to the (western) mountain with untouched splendour 1
6. Your host, O Maruts, shone forth when, O sages, you strip, like a caterpillar, the waving tree 1
p. 326
[paragraph continues]
Conduct then, O friends, our service 2 to a good end, as the eye conducts the man in walking.
7. That man, O Maruts, is not overpowered, he is not killed, he does not fail, he does not shake, he does not drop, his goods do not perish, nor his protections, if you lead him rightly, whether he be a seer or a king.
8. The men with their steeds, like conquerors of clans, like Aryaman (Mitra and Varuna) 1, the Maruts, carrying waterskins 2, fill the well; when the strong ones roar, they moisten the earth with the juice of sweetness 3.
9. When the Maruts come forth this earth bows, the heaven bows, the paths in the sky bow, and the cloud-mountains with their quickening rain.
10. When you rejoice at sunrise, O Maruts, toiling together 1, men of Svar (sun-light), men of Dyu (heaven), your horses never tire in running, and you quickly reach the end of your journey.
11. On your shoulders are the spears, on your feet rings, on your chests golden chains, O Maruts, on your chariot gems; fiery lightnings in your fists, and golden headbands tied round your heads 1.
12. O Maruts, you shake the red apple 1 from the firmament, whose splendour no enemy 2 can touch; the hamlets bowed when the Maruts blazed, and the pious people (the Maruts) intoned their far-reaching shout.
13. O wise Maruts, let us carry off 1 the wealth of food which you have bestowed on us; give us 2, O Maruts, such thousandfold wealth as never fails 3, like the star Tishya 4 from heaven!
14. O Maruts, you protect our wealth of excellent men, and the seer, clever in song; you give to
p. 327
[paragraph continues]
Bharata (the warrior) 1 a strong horse 2, you make the king to be obeyed 3.
15. O you who are quickly ready to help, I implore you for wealth whereby we may overshadow all men, like the sky. O Maruts, be pleased with this word of mine, and let us speed by its speed over a hundred winters!
p. 328
NOTES.
The same poet, Syâvâsva Âtreya. Metre, 1-13, 15 Gagatî; 14 Trishtubh. None of the verses of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB., MS.
Verse 1.
Note 1. Anaga, explained as a 2nd pers. plur. perf., referring to the same people who are addressed by arkata. It may be also the first person of the imperative; see Benfey, Über die Entstehung der mit r anlautenden Personalendungen, p. 5, note.
Note 2. Possibly the second line of this verse may refer to ceremonial technicalities. Gharma means heat and summer, but also the sacrificial vessel (formus) in which the milk is heated, and the warm milk itself. Yagvan can only mean sacrificing, and divah prishtha is the back of heaven, the highest roof of heaven; see triprishtha. Thus we read, I, 115, 3. harítah … diváh â´ prishthám asthuh. See also I, 164, 10; 166, 5; III, 2, 12; IX, 36, 6; 66, 5; 69, 5; 83, 2; 86, 27. It would seem therefore as if the Maruts themselves were here represented as performing sacrificial acts in the highest heaven, praising the milk, that is, the rain, which they pour down from heaven to earth. Possibly the text is corrupt. If yagyu could have the same meaning as prayagyu, I should like to conjecture, diváh â´ prishthám yágyave. In IX, 61, 12. índrâya yágyave seems to mean 'to the chasing Indra.' See also âyagi (erjagend), obtaining. Might we conjecture divá â´ prikshayâ´vane? Prikshayâma occurs as a name; see also II, 34, 3.
Verse 3.
Note 1. Abdâ, wish to give water, is very doubtful. Both abda and abdi, in abdimat, mean cloud. The text seems corrupt.
p. 329
Verse 4.
Note 1. The meaning of vyag is doubtful. It may simply mean to make visible.
Verse 5.
Note 1. The last words ánasvadâm yát ní áyâtana girím are difficult, Sâyana has an explanation ready, viz. when you throw down the cloud or the mountain which gives no water or which 'does not give up the horses carried off by the Panis. Grassmann too is ready with an explanation: 'Als ihr unnahbar glänzend, Hirschen gleich, den Berg auf eurer Fahrt durchranntet, den kein Ross erreicht.' Ludwig: 'Als ihr nider gehn machtet den nicht vergängliches gebenden (d. i. die waszer; oder: die rosse verweigernden?) berg.'
Giri may be the cloud, and nothing could be more appropriate than that the Maruts should come down upon the cloud or go over it, in order to make it give up the rain. But asvadâ means 'giving horses,' and though rain-clouds may be compared to horses, it does not follow that asva by itself could mean rain. Asvadâ is used of the dawn, I, 113, 18, possibly as giving horses, that is, wealth, but possibly also, as bringing the horses to the morning sun. These horses start with the dawn or the sun in the morning, and they rest in the evening. The legend that Agni hid himself in an Asvattha tree (Sâyana, RV. I, 65, 1) may owe its origin to asvattha, i. e. horse-stable, having been a name of the West (K. Z. I, 467); cf. tishthadgu, at sunset. In X, 8, 3, the Dawns are called ásvabudhnâh, which may mean that they had their resting-place among the horses. The Maruts, more particularly, are said to dwell in the Asvattha tree, when Indra called them to his help against Vritra; cf. Sat. Brâhm. IV, 3, 3, 6; Pâr. Grihy. II, 15, 4. Possibly therefore, though I say no more, possibly the Dawn or the East might have been called asvadâ, the West anasvadâ, and in that case it might be said that the Maruts are of unsullied splendour, when they
p. 330
go down to the western mountain. M. Bergaigne explains, 'La montagne qui ne donne pas, qui retient le cheval, le cheval mythique, soleil ou éclair.' My own impression, however, is that anasvadâm is an old mistake, though I cannot accept Ludwig's conjecture a-nasva-dâm. Why not ánu svadhâ´m, or anasva-yâh, moving without horses? cf. V, 42, 10.
Verse 6.
Note 1. This is, no doubt, a bold simile, but a very true one. In one night caterpillars will eat off the whole foliage of a tree, and in the same way a violent storm in the autumn will strip every leaf. Arnasám as an adjective, with the accent on the last syllable, does not occur again, but it can hardly mean anything but waving. If it will stand for the sea, we might translate, 'When you clear the waving sea (or air), as the caterpillar a tree.'
Note 2. Arámati seems here to mean service or obedience, not a person who is willing to serve.
Verse 8.
Note 1. To translate aryamánah by friends is unsatisfactory. Bergaigne takes it for Aryaman, Mitra, and Varuna, the three Aryamans, as we say the two Mitras, and points out that these three gods do send rain, in I, 79, 3; VII, 40, 4.
Note 2. It ought to be kavandhínah as much as kávandha, V, 85, 3.
Note 3. Mádhvah ándhasâ; Grassmann, 'mit des Honigs Seim.'
Verse 10.
Note 1. Sabharas is evidently a recognised epithet of the Maruts, see VS. XVII, 81 and 84, but its meaning is doubtful. We have visvábharasam, IV, I, 19, as an epithet of Agni, which does not help us much. If bharas means burden, sabharas may mean those who work together, companions, friends.
p. 331
Verse 11.
Note 1. See Muir, S. T. V, p. 149. On síprâh &c., see II, 34, 3, note.
Verse 12.
Note 1. The red apple to be shaken from the firmament can only be the lightning. Vi-dhû is construed with two accusatives, as in III, 45, 4; V, 57, 3. Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 266.
Note 2. Aryáh cannot be a vocative, on account of the accent, nor a nominative on account of the context. There remains nothing but to take it as a genitive, and connect it with agribhîta, though such a construction has few parallels, except perhaps in such sentences as hávyah karshanînâ´m, VI, 22, 1, &c. Possibly it may be intended as an epithet of the Maruts. Bergaigne (Journ. As. 1884, p. 190), 'au profit du pauvre.' Geldner (Ved. Stud. I, p. 148) proposes a very bold translation: 'The sacrificial nets are being contracted, when the Maruts rush on. The priests (ritâyu) roar their (as catching-net) extended shouting.' The sense is said to be that when the Maruts appear, all priests try to catch them by shouting. See, however, Oldenberg in Gött. Gel. Anzeigen, 1890, p. 414.
Verse 13.
Note 1. For rathyãh, see II, 24, 1, 5. râyáh syâma rathyãh vayasvatah; VI, 48, 9.
Note 2. Râranta, 2nd pers. plur. imp. intens., but Pada has raranta. Why not rarâta?
Note 3. Yukkhati has been compared by Kuhn (K. Z. III, 328) with δύσκει; but see Brugmann, Grundriss, I, pp. 110, 118.
Note 4. Tishya must be the name of a star, hardly, as Sâyana suggests, of the sun. It ought to be a star which does not set. See Weber, Über alte iranische Sternnamen, p. 14. Ludwig quotes from TS. II, 2, 10, 1 seq., an identification of Tishya with Rudra.
p. 332
Verse 14.
Note 1. Grassmann marks this verse as late, Ludwig defends it. We must know what is meant by late before we decide. Bharata may mean simply a warrior, or a Bharata; see Ludwig, III, 175-176; Oldenberg, Buddha (1st edition), p. 413.
Note 2. Árvantam vâ´gam, a horse, his strength. See Bergaigne, Rel. Véd. II, 405; Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 46.
Note 3. Could srushtimat here mean obedient?

"
26,"MANDALA V, HYMN 55.","ASHTAKA IV, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 17-18.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. The chasing 1 Maruts with gleaming spears, the golden-breasted, have gained great strength, they move along on quick well-broken horses;—when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.
2. You have yourselves, you know, acquired power; you shine bright and wide, you great ones. They have even measured the sky with their strength;—when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.
3. The strong heroes, born together, and nourished together, have further grown to real beauty. They shine brilliantly like the rays of the sun;—when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.
4. Your greatness, O Maruts, is to be honoured, it is to be yearned for like the sight of the sun. Place us also in immortality;—when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.
5. O Maruts you raise 1 the rain from the sea, and rain it down, O yeomen 2! Your milch-cows, O destroyers 3, are never destroyed;—when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.
6. When you have joined the deer as horses 1 to the shafts, and have clothed yourselves in golden garments, then, O Maruts, you scatter all enemies;—when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.
7. Not mountains, not rivers have kept you back, wherever you see, O Maruts, there you go. You
p. 334
go even round heaven and earth;—when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.
8. Be it old, O Maruts, or be it new, be it spoken, O Vasus, or be it recited, you take cognisance of it all;—when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.
9. Have mercy on us, O Maruts, do not strike us, extend to us your manifold protection. Do remember the praise, the friendship;—when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.
10. Lead us, O Maruts, towards greater wealth, and out of tribulations, when you have been praised. O worshipful Maruts, accept our offering, and let us be lords of treasures!
p. 335
NOTES.
The same poet, Syâvâsva Âtreya. Metre, 1-9 Gagatî; 10 Trishtubh. None of the verses occurs in SV., VS., AV. Verse 5 is found in TS. II, 4, 8, 2; MS. II, 4, 7. The refrain probably means that when the Maruts march in triumph, the chariots of their army, or the chariots of other gods, follow. The latter view is taken by Sâyana, TS. II, 4, 8, 2.
Verse 1.
Note 1. Práyagyu, generally explained by rushing forward, but in that sense hardly to be derived from yag, to sacrifice, may stand for an old Vedic form prayakshyu, changed into prayagyu by priests who had forgotten the root yaksh, and thought of nothing but sacrifices. This root yaksh has been identified by Grassmann with OHG. jagôn (venari, persequi), originally to rush after, to hunt, to try to injure or kill (cf. mriganyávah, X, 40, 4). This would explain most derivations from yaksh, not excepting the later Yakshas, and . would yield an excellent sense for prayakshyu, as an epithet of the Maruts. Sec note to VII, 56, 16. Pischel, Ved. Stud. I, p. 98, is satisfied with deriving prayagyu and prishthaprayag from the root yag, to sacrifice, and translates it by sacrificing, but in the sense of causing sacrifices to be offered.
Verse 5.
Note 1. The verb îrayatha is transitive; see Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 54, and compare AV. IV, 27, 4. apáh samudrâ´d dívam úd vahanti.
Note 2. I have translated purîshinah by yeomen, in the sense of cultivators of the land. I have followed Roth, who shows that purîsha means soil, and that purîshin is used for an occupier of the soil, a landlord. See K. Z. XXVI, p. 65.
Note 3. Dasra, powerful, a common epithet of the Asvins, seems here, when joined with dasyanti, to retain something
p. 336
of its etymological meaning, which comes out clearly in dâs, to attack, unless it is derived from dams.
Verse 6.
Note 1. I prefer to translate here 'the deer as horses,' not 'the speckled horses.' See, however, II, 34, 4, and Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 226.

"
27,"MANDALA V, HYMN 56.","ASHTAKA IV, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 19-20.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. O Agni, on to the strong host (of the Maruts), bedecked with golden chains and ornaments 1. Today I call the folk of the Maruts down from the light of heaven.
2. As thou (Agni) thinkest in thine heart, to the same object my wishes have gone. Strengthen thou these Maruts, terrible to behold, who have come nearest to thy invocations.
3. Like a bountiful lady 1, the earth comes towards us, staggering, yet rejoicing; for your onslaught, O Maruts, is vigorous, like a bear, and fearful, like a wild bull.
4. They who by their strength disperse wildly 1 like bulls, impatient of the yoke, they by their marches make the heavenly stone, the rocky mountain (cloud) 2 to shake.
5. Arise, for now I call with my hymns 1 the troop of these Maruts, grown strong together, the manifold, the incomparable, as if calling a drove of bulls.
6. Harness the red mares to the chariot, harness the ruddy horses to the chariots, harness the two bays, ready to drive in the yoke, most vehement to drive in the yoke.
7. And this red stallion too, loudly neighing, has been placed here, beautiful to behold; may it not cause you delay on your marches, O Maruts; spur him forth on your chariots.
p. 338
8. We call towards us the glorious chariot of the Maruts, whereon there stands also Rodasî 1, carrying delightful gifts, among the Maruts.
9. I call hither this your host, brilliant on chariots, terrible and glorious, among which she, the wellborn and fortunate, the bounteous lady, is also magnified among the Maruts.
p. 339
NOTES.
The same poet and deity, though Agni is invoked in the first, possibly in the second verse also. Metre, 1, 2, 4-6, 8, 9 Brihatî; 3, 7 Satobrihatî. None of the verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., MS.
Verse 1.
Note 1. Here again some interpreters of the Veda take añgi in the sense of paint, war-paint. It may be so, but the more general meaning of colours or ornament seems, as yet, safer.
Verse 3.
Note 1. The earth is frequently represented as trembling under the fury of the Maruts. Here she is first called mîlhúshmatî, a curious compound which, in our verse, may possibly have a more special meaning. As the earth is not only struck down by the storm, but at the same time covered with water and fertilised, she is represented as struck down and staggering, but likewise as rejoicing, possibly, as drunk.
Verse 4.
Note 1. Vríthâ means pell-mell, confusedly, wildly; see also Geldner, Ved. Stud. p. 115.
Note 2. Ásmâ svaryãh seems to mean the thunderbolt like vágrah svaryãh in I, 32, 2; 67, 6. See also V, 30, 8. In that case we should have to translate, 'they let the heavenly bolt fall down on the rocky mountain.' But kyâvayati is never used for the hurling of the thunderbolt, nor is it construed with two accusatives. It always means to shake what is firm, and we have therefore to translate, they shake the heavenly stone (the sky), the rocky mountain (the cloud).' Parvata and giri often occur together, as in I, 37, 7; VIII, 64, 5.
Verse 5.
Note 1. Stómaih may possibly refer to sámukshitânâm.
Verse 8.
Note 1. On Rodasî´, see before, I, 167, 3.

28,"MANDALA V, HYMN 57.","ASHTAKA IV, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 21-22.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. O Rudras, joined by Indra, friends on golden chariots, come hither for our welfare! This prayer from us is acceptable to you like the springs of heaven to a thirsty soul longing for water.
2. O you sons of Prisni, you are armed with daggers and spears, you are wise, carrying good bows and arrows and quivers, possessed of good horses and chariots. With your good weapons, O Maruts, you go to triumph!
3. You shake 1 the sky and the mountains (clouds) for wealth to the liberal giver; the forests bend down out of your way from fear 2. O sons of Prisni, you rouse the earth when you, O terrible ones, have harnessed the spotted deer for triumph!
4. The Maruts, blazing with the wind, clothed in rain, are as like one another as twins, and well adorned. They have tawny horses, and red horses, they are faultless, endowed with exceeding vigour; they are in greatness wide as the heaven.
5. Rich in rain-drops, well adorned, bounteous, terrible to behold, of inexhaustible wealth, noble by birth, golden-breasted, these singers of the sky 1 have obtained their immortal name 2.
6. Spears are on your two shoulders, in your arms are placed strength, power, and might. Manly thoughts dwell in your heads, on your chariots are weapons, and every beauty has been laid on your bodies.

7. O Maruts, you have given us wealth of cows, horses, chariots, and heroes, golden wealth! O men of Rudra, bestow on us great praise, and may I enjoy your divine protection!

The same poet and deity. Metre, 1-6 Gagatî; 7, 8 Trishtubh. None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS.; verse 6 in MS. IV, II, 4.
Verse 3.
Note 1. Dhû is construed with two accusatives, see RV. III, 45, 4; otherwise vâsu might be connected with dâsúshe. The third pâda is 3 literally repeated soon after, V, 60, 2; see note 1 to I, 37, 7.
Note 2. Yâ´manah bhiyâ´ may be from fear of your approach.
Verse 5.
Note 1. In diváh arkâ´h even Bergaigne allows that arká may mean singer, not song.
Note 2. Nâ´ma, name, is here as elsewhere what is meant by the name, therefore immortal being or immortality.
Verse 8.
Note 1. Bríhadgirayah cannot well mean with a powerful voice. The Maruts are called girishtha, VIII, 94, 12, dwelling on mountains, and like brihaddiva, brihadgiri seems to have been intended for dwelling on high mountains.

"
29,"MANDALA V, HYMN 58.","ASHTAKA IV, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 23.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. I praise 1 now the powerful company of these ever-young Maruts, who drive violently along with quick horses; aye, the sovereigns are lords of Amrita (the immortal).
2. The terrible company, the powerful, adorned with quoits on their hands, given to roaring, potent, dispensing treasures, they who are beneficent, infinite in greatness, praise, O poet, these men of great wealth!
3. May your water-carriers come here to-day, all the Maruts who stir up the rain. That fire which has been lighted for you, O Maruts, accept it, O young singers
4. O worshipful Maruts, you create for man an active king, fashioned by Vibhvan 1; from you comes the man who can fight with his fist, and is quick with his arm, from you the man with good horses and valiant heroes.
5. Like the spokes of a wheel, no one is last, like the days they are born on and on, not deficient in might. The very high sons of Prisni are full of fury, the Marut cling firmly to their own will 1.
6. When you have come forth with your speckled deer as horses 1 on strong-fellied chariots, O Maruts, the waters gush, the forests go asunder 2;—let Dyu 3 (Sky) roar down, the bull of the Dawn.
7. At their approach, even the earth opened wide,

The same poet and deity. Metre, Trishtubh. None of the verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS. Verses 3 and 5 are found in TB. II, 5, 5, 3; II, 8, 5, 7; MS. IV, 11, 2; IV, 4, 18.
Verse 1.
Note 1. On stushé, see M. M., Selected Essays, I, p. 162; Wilhelm, De infinitivi forma et usu, p. 10; Bartholomae, in Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XV, p. 219. I take stushé as 1 pers. sing. Aor. Âtm. (not, as Avery, of the Present) in many places where it has been taken as an infinitive. For instance, II, 31, 5; VI, 49, 1; 51, 3 (with voke); 62, 1 (with huve); VIII, 5, 4; 7, 32; 74, 1; 84, 1 (here the second pâda must begin with stushé). It may be an indicative or a subjunctive. As to stushe, without an accent, its character cannot be doubtful; see I, 122, 8; 159, 1; V, 33, 6; VI, 21, 2; 48, 14; VIII, 21, 9; 23, 2; 23, 7 (grine). In II, 20, 4, tám u stushe índram tám grinîshe, grinîshe is an aorist with vikarana, like punîshé, I praise that Indra, I laud him. In I, 46, 1, stushé may be the infinitive, but not necessarily. It is an infinitive in I, 122, 7. stushé sâ vâm varuna mitra râtíh, your gift, Varuna and Mitra, is to be praised. Likewise in VIII, 4, 17 (see BR. s. v. simian); 24, 1; 63, 3, though in several of these passages it must remain doubtful whether stushé should be taken as an absolute infinitive, or as a finite verb. In VIII, 65, 5, índra grinîshé u stushé, means, 'Indra, I laud and praise,' as in II, 20, 4.
Verse 4.
Note 1. Vibhva-tashtá is generally explained as made by a master, or by Vibhvan, one of the Ribhus. This may be so, though it seems a bold expression (see Bergaigne, II, 410-411). But may it not be a mere synonym of sutashta, and intended for vibhvane tashta? see Selected Essays, I, p. 143.

Verse 6.
Note 1. On príshatîbhih ásvaih, see II, 34, 4; V, 55, 6. Bergaigne's note (II, p. 378) does not settle the question whether the horses of the Maruts were speckled, or whether they had speckled deer for their horses.

Note 3. Dyaus, the father of the Maruts, the oldest and highest god of heaven, the strong bull, or, it may be, the man of the dawn. See v. Bradke, Dyaus Asura, p. 63; Bergaigne, I, p. 316.
Verse 7.
Note 1. Roth conjectures svâm for svám, taking it as a locative of sû, genetrix. This is not without difficulties, nor is it necessary. That we find in the Rig-veda no other locative in âm after monosyllabic stems in û is perhaps no serious objection. But the text as it stands can be translated, 'as a husband the germ, they have placed (sown) their own strength.' Sávas is the same as vríshnyam and vríshni sávah in VIII, 3, 8; 10. Dhuh is used like dhâ in retodhâ.

NOTES.
The same poet and deity. Metre, 1-7 Gagatî; 8 Trishtubh. None of the verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TB., TS., MS.
Verse 1.
Note 1. If we accept the text as it stands, we have to translate, 'The spy called out to you to grant welfare.' The spy is then either Agni (Bergaigne, II, p. 378) or the priest. See also VIII, 61, 15; X, 35, 8. But there are many objections to this. Pra-krand is not used in that sense, and we should expect pra krânt suvitâya. Pra-kar, when it is construed with a dative, means generally to prepare some one for something, to cause some one to do a thing. Thus, I, 186, 10. pró asvínau ávase krinudhvam. get the Asvins to protect. VI, 21, 9. prá ûtáye várunam mitrám índram marûtah krishva ávase nah adyá, make Varuna, Mitra, and Indra to protect, make the Maruts to protect us to-day. X, 64, 7. prá vah vâyúm—stómaih krinudhvam sakhyâ´ya pûshánam, make Vâyu by your praises to be your friend. I, 112, 8. prá andhám sronám kákshase étaye kritháh, whereby you make the blind and lame to see and to walk. The poet therefore seems to have said in our verse also, 'They (my men or priests) made you or wished you to give them welfare.' What spat can mean in such a sentence, is difficult to say. Till we know better, we must simply accept it as a particle of asseveration, like bat.
Note 2. Árkâ may also be the first person.
Verse 2.
Note 1. With regard to vyâthir yatî´, cf. I, 117, 15. samudrám avyathír gaganvâ´n, and VIII, 45, 19. vyáthir gaganvâ´msah; Bergaigne, Journ. As. 1884, p. 490.
Note 2. Mahé vidáthe must be taken as a locative sing. It occurs again X, 96, 1. We have similar forms in mahé ráne, IX, 66, 13. &c. The locative is governed by antáh,
p. 350
as in II, 27, 8. vidáthe antáh eshâm. The etymology and the meaning of vidatha have been often discussed, for the last time by M. Regnaud, Revue de l’histoire des religions, 1890. Prof. Roth, as M. Regnaud states, explains it by conseil, avis, réunion où l’on délibère, assemblée, troupe, armée. Grassmann takes it generally for réunion, rencontre, combat. Geldner derives it from vid, in the sense of art, science. Ludwig derives it likewise from vid, but in the sense .of Bekanntschaft, then Gesellschaft, and lastly as synonymous with yagña, sacrifice, assemblage. M. Regnaud differs from all his predecessors, and derives vidatha from vidh, to sacrifice. He maintains that *vidhatha would become vidatha, like adhak from dah or dhagh, and phaliga for parigha. I know nothing about the etymology of phaliga, but if it stands for parigha, the second aspirate has lost its aspiration and thrown it on the initial. In adhak, the final has lost its aspiration, and thus allowed its appearance in the initial. But in vidatha, if it stood for vidhatha, there would be no phonetic excuse whatever for changing dh into d, at least in Sanskrit. It is possible that in Sanskrit such a form as vidhatha might have been avoided, but there is no phonetic law to prevent the formation of such a word as vidhatha, like ukatha, yagatha, &c. We say vidhatha in the 2 pers. plur., as we say bodhatha. No Sanskrit grammarian could derive vidatha from vidh. If therefore vidatha signifies sacrifice, this is not because it is derived from vidh, to sacrifice. Vidatha may have been the name of a sacred act, as veda is of sacred knowledge. But the fact remains that it is best translated by assembly, particularly an assembly for sacrificial purposes.
Verse 3.
Note 1. On sriyáse, see I, 87, 6.
Note 2. I see no necessity for changing sûryah into sûrah, see Bergaigne, Mélanges Renier, p. 94. He would translate, 'they are like the eye of the sun.'
Note 3. Máryâh may be bridegrooms, as in V, 60, 4
p. 351
[paragraph continues]
(varâ´h iva), but there is nothing to indicate that meaning here. The difficulty is to find a word to express sriyáse. It means to shine, but at the same time to excel. Possibly it may have even a more definite meaning, such as to shine in battle, or to triumph.

Verse 7.
Note 1. On srénîh, see Gaedicke, p. 164; Bergaigne, Mél. Renier, p. 94.
Note 2. The meaning of nabhanú, spring, is doubtful.
Note 3. Ubháye refers to many on both sides, and cannot be taken for ubhe, heaven and earth. It may mean all, particularly when there are two sides only, as in a battle.
Verse 8.
Note 1. Ludwig seems to have seen the true meaning of this verse, namely that, though Dyaus may roar for the feast, and though the Dawns may strive to come near, the Maruts alone deserve the sacrifice, because they opened the chest of rain.
Note 2. On Dyaus Aditi, see note to I, 166, 12, p. 261, where the translation has to be corrected.

NOTES.
This hymn, by the same poet, is supposed to be addressed either to the Maruts alone, or to the Maruts and Agni. The same might have been said of hymn 56 and others which are used for the Âgnimâruta Sastra. See Bergaigne, Recherches sur l’histoire de la liturgie védique, p. 38. Metre, 1-6 Trishtubh; 7, 8 Gagatî. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB., except verse i in AV. VII, 50, 3; TB. II, 7, 12, 4; MS. IV, 14, 11; verse 3 in TS. III, 1, 11, 5; MS. IV, 12, 5; verse 6 in TB. II, 7, 12, 4.
Verse 1.
The AV. reads svâ´vasum, prasaktó, pradakshinám, all of them inferior readings. The TB. agrees with RV., except that it seems to read prasaptáh (prakarshena samâgatah).
Note 1. That îl or îd has originally the meaning of imploring, asking, begging, we see from such passages as RV. III, 48, 3. upasthâya mâtáram ánnam aitta, 'he, having approached his mother, asked for food,' unless we prefer to construe îd with two accusatives, 'he, having approached, asked his mother for food.' The same verb is also construed with the accusative of the god implored, the dative of the object, and the instrumental of the means by which he is implored. See RV. VIII, 71, 14. agním îlishva ávase gâ´thâbhih, implore Agni with songs for his protection. Whether the root îd is distantly connected with either ish, to desire (Brugmann, I, 591), or with ard, to stir, or with ar, to go, is a question which admits of many, or of no answer.
Note 2. Viki kritam seems to have the settled meaning of gathering in what one has made at play, or in battle; see X, 42, 9; 43, 5; IX, 97, 58; X, 102, 2. The same meaning is applicable here, though we may also translate, Take notice of our krita or our karma, i. e. the sacrifice.' A similar thought is expressed in verse 6. Sâyana explains vigânâtu and vikinuyât.
Note 3. Perhaps prá bhare means, 'I am carried forth,' as in V, 59, 4, where it is applied to the Maruts.
p. 355
Verse 4.
Note 1. See note 2 to I, 6, 4. Instead of svadhâ´bhih we have svayám in VII, 56, 11.
Note 2. Sriyé sréyâmsah is difficult to translate; cf. II, 33, 3. sréshthah sriyâ´ asi. Ludwig translates, zu herlichkeit die herlichen.
Verse 7.
Note 1. On risâdas, see Aufrecht, Bezzenb. Beitr. XIV, p. 32.
Verse 8.
Note 1. On ganasrî´, see BR. s. v.; Lanman, 372; Benfey Vedica und Verwandtes, p. 108; Pischel, Ved. Stud. I, 53 seq. Ludwig translates scharenherlich, but what does that mean? 'Shining in their companies' is a possible meaning, but the analogy of abhisrî´ and adhvarasrî´ points in another direction.

NOTES.
This hymn is of a very composite nature. It is addressed to the Maruts by Syâvâsva. According to the Anukramanî, however, the Maruts are addressed in vv. 1-4, 11-16 only; vv. 5-8 are addressed to Sasîyasî Tarantamahishî, 9 to Purumîlha Vaidadasvi, 10 to Taranta Vaidadasvi, 17-19 to Rathavîti Dârbhya. None of the verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB., MS. Metre, 1-4, 6-8, 10-19 Gâyatrî; 5 Anushtubh; 9 Satobrihatî.
It has been pointed out that in the hymns addressed to the Maruts beginning with V, 52, and ending with V, 60, there is the usual decrease in the number of verses of each successive hymn, viz. 17, 16, 15, 10, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8. Our hymn, however, which is the last in the collection of hymns addressed by Syâvâsva to the Maruts, breaks the rule, and it has been suggested with great plausibility that it contains a number of verses thrown together at random. Possibly the four verses in the beginning formed an independent hymn, addressed to the Maruts, and again 5-10, and 11-16, followed by an appendix, 17-19. These verses refer to a legend which will have to be discussed at verse 5.
Verse 1.
Note 1. As to paramásyâh parâvátah, see TS. IV, 1, 9, 3, where we also find (IV, 1, 9, 2) párasyâ ádhi samvátah.
Verse 3.
Note 1. Gagháne, like gaghanatah, may mean simply behind, as agre and agratah mean before.
Note 2. It is clear that the Maruts are here supposed to sit astride on their horses. This is also shown by prishthé sádas (v. 2), and by putrakrithé ná gánayah, they stretched out their legs, ὡς γυναῖκες ἐν τεκνοποιίᾳ. Zimmer (p. 230) says, 'Zum Reiten wurde das Ross nicht benutzt.' On p. 295 he modifies this by saying, 'Keine einzige klare Stelle des Rig-veda ist mir bekannt, wo das Reiten beim Kampfe erwähnt wurde; man fährt immer zu Wagen, wie die Griechen in homerischen Zeiten.'
p. 359
Verse 4.
Note 1. Bhádragânayah, generally rendered by 'possessed of beautiful wives,' seems really to mean 'possessed of an excellent mother.' Gâni clearly means mother, when Agni dvimâtâ, having two mothers, is called dvigânih; for it is never said that he has two wives. Besides, the Maruts are constantly addressed as the sons of their mother, Prisni, while their wives are mentioned but rarely. However, the other meaning is not impossible. See also Bergaigne, II, 387 seq.
Note 2. The fire here intended is, I suppose, the sacrificial fire, to which the Maruts are here invited as they had been in former hymns.
Verse 5.
Note 1. Ludwig compares the A. S. expression healsgebedde; see also RV. X, 10, 10.
Note 2. I have very little belief in the legends which are told in the Brâhmanas and in the Anukramanî in illustration of certain apparently personal and historical allusions in the hymns of the Veda. It is clear in many cases that they are made up from indications contained in the hymns. as in IX, 58, 3, and it seems best therefore to forget them altogether in interpreting the words of the Vedic hymns.
The story told in the introductory verses, quoted by Sâyana, is this:—'Arkanânas Âtreya was chosen by Rathavîti Dârbhya to be his Ritvig priest. At the sacrifice Arkanânas saw the daughter of Rathavîti and asked her in marriage for his son Syâvâsva. Rathavîti consulted his wife, but she declined on the ground that no daughter of theirs had ever been given to a man who was not a poet (Rishi). Thereupon Syâvâsva performed penance, and travelled about collecting alms. He thus came to Sasîyasî, who recommended him, as a Rishi, to her husband, king Taranta. King Taranta was very generous to him, and sent him on to his younger brother, Purumîlha. On his way to Purumîlha, Syâvâsva saw the Maruts, and composed a hymn in their praise (vv. 11-16). He had thus become a real poet or Rishi, and on returning home, he received from Rathavîti his daughter in marriage.'
p. 360
Saunaka confirms the same story, see Sâyana's commentary to V, 61, 17. Here therefore we have to deal with two princely brothers, both Vaidadasvis, namely Taranta and Purumîlha. They both give presents to Syâvâsva, who is a Brâhmana, and he marries the daughter of another prince, Rathavîti Dârbhya.
In the Tândya-Brâhmana, however, XIII, 7, 12, another story is told, which I quoted in my edition of the Rig-veda at IX, 58, 3 (vol. v, p. xxxiii). Here Dhvasra and Purushanti are introduced as wishing to give presents to the two Vaidadasvis, Taranta and Purumîlha. These hesitate for a while, because they have no right to accept a present without deserving it or having done something for it. They then compose a hymn in praise of Dhvasra and Purushanti, and after that feel justified in accepting their present.
Here therefore the Vaidadasvis are receivers, not givers of presents, therefore of princely, not, as has been supposed, of priestly rank, and this would agree better with the words of verse 9, purumîlhâ´ya víprâya. See on all this Oldenberg in Z. D. M. G. XLII, p. 232.
If we accept this story, we have to take sásîyasî in verse 6 as a proper name.
But sásîyasî may be a comparative of sas-vat (see B.-R. s. v.), and would then mean, more frequent. We expect, no doubt, an adverb rather like sasvat, but a feminine corresponding to vásyasî is perhaps admissible. In that case we should have simply to deal with some woman, tvâ strî´, who, as the poet says, is as good as, if not better than, many a man.
Verse 8.
This verse is very obscure. Sâyana translates: 'And the other half (the husband of Sasîyasî, viz. Taranta) is a man not praised (enough), thus I, the poet, say: and that Taranta is equal or just in the giving of wealth.' Grassmann translates: 'Und dagegen ist mancher nicht lobenswerth geizig, der ein Mann sich nennt, ein solcher ist der Strafe verfallen.' Ludwig: 'Auch mancher halbmensch,
p. 361
ungepriesen, der “mensch” zwar heiszt, doch ein Pani ist, der ist auf böse gabe nur bedacht.'
The first light that was thrown on this verse came from Prof. Roth. He showed (Z. D. M. G. XLI, p. 673) that vairadeya means weregild, the German wergelt, the price to be given for a man killed. Vaira would here be derived from vîra, man, the Goth. waír, the Latin vir, and vairadeya would mean what is to be given as the value of a man. Still I doubt whether Prof. Roth has discovered the true meaning of the verse. He translates: 'So ist auch mancher Mann nicht zu loben, mehr ein Pani (unfromm, gegen die Götter karg, zugleich Bezeichnung habsüchtiger Dämonen), obschon man ihn einen Menschen nennt—nur am Wergeld steht er den andern gleich.' I confess I do not see much point in this. It is quite clear that the poet praises a charitable woman, and wishes to say that she is sometimes better than a man, if he gives nothing. Now the weregild, if we may say so, for women was generally, though not always, less than that for men, and I therefore propose to read sâ´ vaíradeye ít samâ´, and translate: 'Even though many an unpraiseworthy miser (Pani) is called man, she is like him in weregild, i. e. she is worth as much, even though she is a woman.' On uta, see Delbrück, Syntaktische Forschungen, V, p. 528.
Verse 9.
Note 1. Purumîlha is here clearly the man from whom benefits are expected, and therefore could not be the same as Purumîlha Vaidadasvi, mentioned by the commentator, who accepted gifts from Dhvasra and Purushanti. Nor can Taranta Vaidadasvi in the next verse be taken for a recipient, but only for a giver, and therefore, most likely, a prince. The whole story, however, is by no means clear, and I doubt whether the commentator drew his information from any source except his own brain.
Verse 11.
I agree with Ludwig that a new hymn begins with verse 11.
p. 362
Verse 12.
Note 1. I have adopted the reading Rodasî´ vibhrâ´gate in my translation; cf. VI, 66, 6, where Rodasî is compared with a rókah.
Note 2. Roth (K. Z. XXVI, 51) takes sriyâ´dhi as sriyás ádhi, but such a sandhi has not yet been established in the hymns of the Rig-veda, see Oldenberg, Proleg. p. 459, Anm. 1. Oldenberg himself suggests sríyóऽdhi, and would translate, 'They whose charms shine over the two worlds on their chariots.' Pischel (Ved. Stud. p. 54) translates yéshâm sriyâ´ by 'for whose sake.'
Verse 15.
Note 1. On itthâ´ dhiyâ´, see Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 184.
Verse 16.
Note 1. The Pada ought to have puru-kandrâ´, as suggested by Grassmann and Ludwig.
Verses 17-19.
These verses are very peculiar, and may refer to historical events, for Dâlbhya or Dârbhya and Rathavîti sound like real names. Of course the Indian commentators are never at a loss to tell us what it all refers to, but we can never say how little they knew, and how much they invented. The invocation of Ûrmyâ, if it is meant for the Night, and the request that she may convey the hymn to Dârbhya, is different from the usual style of the hymns. See, however, VIII, 24, 28, and Oldenberg, Z. D. M. G. XXXIX, 89.
The following names, occurring in our hymn, have the sanction of the Anukramanî: Sasîyasî Tarantamahishî (V, 61, 5; 8), Purumîlha Vaidadasvi (V, 61, 9), Taranta Vaidadasvi (V, 61, 10), Rathavîti Dâlbhya (V, 61, 17-19). There is another Purumîlha, a Sauhotra, in IV, 43, and a Purumîlha Âṅgirasa in VIII, 71.
Verse 19.
Note 1. See Oldenberg, Z. D. M. G. XXXIX, 89. He corrects gómatîh to gómatîm, the name of a river, mentioned in a very similar way in VIII, 24, 30.

3. They who are heard with their voice from the high heaven, the brilliant and strong, Evayâmarut, in whose council no tyrant 1 reigns, the rushing chariots 2 of these roaring Maruts come forth 3, like fires with their own lightning.
4. The wide-striding (Vishnu) 1 strode forth from the great common seat, Evayâmarut. When he has started by himself from his own place along the ridges, O ye striving, mighty 2 Maruts, he goes together with the heroes (the Maruts), conferring blessings.
5. Impetuous, like your own shout, the strong one (Vishnu) made everything tremble, the terrible, the wanderer 1, the mighty, Evayâmarut; strong with him you advanced self-luminous, with firm reins, golden coloured, well-armed 2, speeding along.
6. Your greatness is infinite, ye Maruts, endowed
p. 364
with full power, may that terrible power help, Evayâmarut. In your raid 1 you are indeed to be seen as charioteers; deliver us therefore from the enemy, like shining fires.
7. May then these Rudras, lively like fires and with vigorous shine, help, Evayâmarut. The seat of the earth is stretched out far and wide 1, when the hosts of these faultless Maruts come quickly to the races.
8. Come kindly on your path, O Maruts, listen to the call of him who praises you, Evayâmarut. Confidants of the great Vishnu, may you together, like charioteers, keep all hateful things far 1, by your wonderful skill.
9. Come zealously 1 to our sacrifice, ye worshipful, hear our guileless call, Evayâmarut. Like the oldest mountains in the sky, O wise guardians, prove yourselves for him irresistible to the enemy.
p. 365
NOTES.
This hymn is evidently a later addition at the end of the fifth Mandala. It is addressed to the Maruts, and is ascribed to Evayâmarut Âtreya. None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB., MS., except the first, which is found in SV. I, 462. Metre, Atigagatî.
The name of the poet is due to the refrain Evayâ´marut which occurs in every verse, and sometimes as an integral portion of the verse. Evayâ´marut is a sacrificial shout, much like Εὐοῖ in Greek, Evoe in Latin, though I do not mean to say that the two are identical. Evayâh, as I explained in note to I, 168, 1, is an epithet of Vishnu, as well as of the Maruts, meaning quickly moving. Evayâmarut, therefore, may mean the 'quick Marut.' This is strange, no doubt, because in the Rig-veda the Maruts always occur in the plural, except in some doubtful passages. Still Evayâmarut, the quick Marut, might be a name of Vishnu. It cannot be taken as a Dvandva, Vishnu and the Maruts.
This hymn was translated by Benfey in his glossary to the Sâma-veda, p. 39. Benfey takes evayâ as identical with εὐοῖ, and explains it as an adverbial instrumental, like âsuyâ, in the sense of stürmisch. But this would leave evayâvan unexplained.
Verse 1.
Note 1. Giri gâ´h may mean 'produced on the mountains,' but it may also mean 'produced in the throat or voice,' and it is so explained elsewhere, for instance in SV. I, 462 (Bibl. Ind., vol. i, p. 922). girau vâki nishpannâh; [also by another commentator, hridaye gâtâ, yagñagâtâ vâ ity uktam]. Oldenberg suggests girige, which would be much better, considering how Vishnu is called girikshit, girishthâ, &c.; see Bergaigne, II, 47. Most of the epithets have occurred before. I take sávase as a substantive, like sardhas, not as an adjective. As to dhûnivrata, see V, 58, 2; as to práyagyu, V, 55, I.
p. 366
Verse 2.
Note 1. Krátvâ, dânâ´, and mahnâ´ seem to me in this place to belong together. The difficulty lies in the transition from vah to eshâm, but this is not uncommon. On mahinâ´ = mahimnâ, dânâ´, and mahnâ´, see Wenzel, Instrumentalis, p. 17; Lanman, p. 533. Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 101, translates, 'Ihre Macht gereicht ihnen zu grosser Gabe.' See also VIII, 20, 14. Gâtâ´h mahinâ´, born by greatness, seems to mean born in greatness, or born great. It would be easy to write mahínâh.
Verse 3.
Note 1. The translation of írî is purely conjectural.
Note 2. Syandrâ´sah, as suggested by Oldenberg, are probably meant for rathâh. Syandana is a carriage in later Sanskrit. In VIII, 20, 2, we have to supply rathaih; in VI, 66, 2, rathâh.
Note 3. Prá, with the verb understood, they come forth; cf. VII, 87, 1. prá árnâmsi samudríyâ nadî´nâm; X, 75, 1. Dhuni, like dhûti, has become almost a name of the Maruts, see I, 64, 5.
Verse 4.
Note 1. The god here meant seems to be Vishnu, mentioned already in verse 1, and probably recalled by the Evayâ in Evayâmarut.
Note 2. 'We must either take víspardhasah and vímahasah with Benfey as names of the horses, or accept them as vocatives, addressed to the Maruts. Vimahas is used as an epithet of the Maruts, see I, 86, 1.
Verse 5.
Note 1. On yayíh, see note to I, 87, 2; but it seems better to take it here as an adjective.
Note 2. On svâyudha, see Geldner, Ved. Stud. I, p. 143; Oldenberg, Gött. Gel. Anzeigen, 1890, p. 424.
Verse 6.
Note 1. Prásiti may be, as Ludwig translates it, fangschnur, a noose, but it can hardly mean Noth, as Grassmann
p. 367
suggests. I take it here in the sense of shooting forth, onslaught, raid; cf. VII, 46, 4. Geldner, Ved. Stud. I, p. 139, takes it for a trap. Lanman, p. 386, is right in considering the locative in au before consonants a sure sign of the modern origin of this hymn.
Verse 7.
Note 1. The idea that the earth is stretched out or becomes large during a thunderstorm has been met with before, V, 58, 7. We read I, 37, 8; 87, 3, that at the racings of the Maruts the earth trembled, and that the Maruts enlarged the fences in their races. I therefore translate, though tentatively only, that the earth is opened far and wide, as a race-course for the faultless Maruts, whose hosts â´, appear, ágmeshu, on the courses, maháh, quickly. If the accent of paprathe could be changed, we might translate, 'at whose coursings (ágmeshu â´) the seat of the earth is quickly stretched out far and wide,' and then take sárdhâmsi ádbhutainasâm in apposition to rudrâ´sah. Adbhutainas, in whom no fault is seen.
Bergaigne translates, 'faisant du mal mystérieusement.' See Geldner, in K. Z. XXVIII, 199, Anm. 2; Bezzenberger's Beiträge, III, 169.
Verse 8.
Note 1. Cf. VI, 48, 10.
Verse 9.
Note 1. Susámi, generally explained as a shortened instrumental, for susamî = susamyâ, used in an adverbial sense. Susámi has a short i here, because it stands at the end of a pâda, otherwise the i is long, see VII, 16, 2; X, 28, 12, even before a vowel. The same applies in the Rig-veda to sami; it has short i at the end of a pâda, see II, 31, 6; VIII, 45, 27; X, 40, 1. The phrase dhiyâ´ sámi, which has short i in II, 31, 6; X, 40, 1, has long i in IX, 74, 7. dhiyâ´ sámî. It is shortened, however, before vowels in the middle of a pâda, and written samy; see I, 87, 5; III, 55, 3.

"
34,"MANDALA VI, HYMN 66.","ASHTAKA V, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 7-8.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. This may well be a marvel, even to an intelligent man, that anything should have taken the same name dhenu, cow:—the one is always brimming to give milk among men, but Prisni (the cloud, the mother of the Maruts) poured out her bright udder once (only).
2. The Maruts who shone like kindled fires, as they grew stronger twice and thrice,—their golden, dustless (chariots 1) became full of manly courage and strength.
3. They who 1 are the sons of the bounteous Rudra, and whom she indeed was strong enough to bear; for she, the great, is known as the mother of the great, that very Prisni conceived the germ for the strong one (Rudra).
4. They who do not shrink from being born in this way 1, and who within (the womb) clean themselves from all impurity 2, when they have been brought forth brilliant, according to their pleasure, they sprinkle their bodies with splendour.
5. Among them there is no one who does not strive to be brought forth quickly; and they assume the defiant name of Maruts. They who are not (unkind 1), never tiring in strength 2, will the generous sacrificer be able to bring down these fierce ones?
6. Fierce in strength, followed by daring armies, these Maruts have brought together heaven and earth 1, both firmly established 2; then the self-shining
p. 369
[paragraph continues]
Rodasî stood among the impetuous Maruts, like 3 a light.
7. Even though your carriage, O Maruts, be without your deer 1, without horse's, and not driven by any charioteer, without drag 2, and without reins, yet, crossing the air 3, it passes between heaven and earth, finishing its courses.
8. No one can stop, no one can overcome him whom you, O Maruts, protect in battle. He whom you protect in his kith, his cattle, his kin, and his waters, he breaks the stronghold at the close of the day 1.
9. Offer a beautiful song to the host of the Maruts, the singers, the quick, the strong, who resist violence with violence; O Agni, the earth trembles before the champions.
10. Blazing like the flame of the sacrifices, flickering like the tongues of the fire, shouters, like roaring fighters, the flame-born Maruts are unassailable.
11. I invite with my call this strong and Marut-like son of Rudra 1, armed with flaming spears. Bright thoughts, like wild waters from the mountain 2, strove to reach the host of heaven.

NOTES.
Hymn ascribed to Bharadvâga Bârhaspatya. None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV. Verse 2 in MS. IV, 14, 11. Verse 9 in TS. IV, 1, 11, 3; TB. II, 8, 5, 5; MS. IV, 10, 3. Verse 10 in MS. IV, 14, 11. Metre, Trishtubh.
Verse 1.
The meaning seems to be that it is strange that two things, namely, a real cow and the cloud, i. e. Prisni, the mother of the Maruts, should both be called dhenu, cow; that the one should always yield milk to men, while the other has her bright udder milked but once. This may mean that dhenu, a cow, yields her milk always, that dhenu, a cloud, yields rain but once, or, that Prisni gave birth but once to the Maruts. See also VI, 48, 22; Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 19; Delbrück, Tempuslehre, p. 102. Dhenu must be taken as the neuter form, and as a nominative, as is shown by II, 37, 2. dadíh yáh nâ´ma pátyate.
Verse 2.
Note 1. It seems necessary to take arenávah hiranyáyâsah for rathâh, chariots, as in V, 87, 3. Sâyana takes the same view, and I do not see how the verse gives sense in any other way. The first pâda might be referred to the Maruts, or to the chariots.
Verse 3.
Note 1. The relative pronouns may be supposed to carry on the subject, viz. Marûtah, from the preceding verse, unless we supply eshâm mâtâ´. I am doubtful about mahó mahî´; cf. I, 102, 1; II, 33, 8. Grassmann proposes to read mahâm, gen. plur.; Ludwig thinks of garbha. It may also be a compound, as in mahâmaha, mahâmahivrata, or an adverb, but the construction remains difficult throughout. Oldenberg suggests that the second pâda may have been yân ko nú prísnih dâ´dhrivih bháradhyai.
p. 371
Verse 4.
Note 1. A tentative rendering and no more. I take áyâ for aya as an adverb in the sense of thus, in this way, see I, 87, 4, note 2. Grassmann seems to take it as an instr. fem., dependent on ganúshah, which is possible, but without analogy. Lanman, p. 358, takes it for áyâh, nom. plur. of aya, wanderer, and translates, 'as long as the ones now wanderers quit not their birth.' Grassmann: 'Die nicht verleugnen die Geburt aus jener.' But is gan with instrumental ever used of a woman giving birth to a child? Ludwig: 'Die sich nicht weigern der geburt.'
Note 2. Pû with accusative occurs AV. XIX, 33, 3.
Verse 5.
This verse is again very obscure. It would be more honest to say that it is untranslatable. Possibly the poet may have taken doháse in the same sense as duhré in verse 4. The Maruts are born as by being milked from the udder of Prisni. It would then mean, 'Among whom there is no one not striving to be born quickly.'
Note 1. Stauna is an unknown word. Sâyana explains it as stena, thieves. It probably meant something not favourable, something that must be denied of the Maruts. This is all we can say. It cannot be a corruption of stavânâh, praised.
Note 2. Ayâ´s can hardly refer to Prisni, never tiring to suckle the Maruts. In B.-R. ayâs is explained as sich nicht anstrengend, behende, leicht, unermüdlich. See also Windisch, K. Z. XXVII, 170; also Johansson, Bezzenb. Beitr. XV, p. 180.
Verse 6.
Note 1. To join together heaven and earth is, as Bergaigne remarks (II, p. 374, n. 1), the apparent effect of a thunderstorm, when the clouds cover both in impenetrable darkness. We have the same expression in VIII, 20, 4.
Note 2. On suméke, see Geldner, K. Z. XXIV, 145; and Windisch, Festgruss an Böhtlingk, p. 114.
Note 3. The ná, placed before rókah, is irregular, see Bergaigne, Mélanges Renier, p. 79. Oldenberg suggests
p. 372
narokâh = nri-okâh, 'she who is fond of the men,' namely, of the Maruts. The corruption may be due to the writers of our text.
Verse 7.
Note 1. Anenáh is strange, and might be changed into anetáh; it cannot be anenâ´h, without guilt.
Note 2. If avasa in an-avasa comes from ava-so, it may mean the step for descending or ascending, or possibly a drag. Bergaigne explains it by sine via tic o.
Note 3. Ragah-tû´h, according to Ludwig, den Staub aufwirbelnd, which seems too much opposed to arenu, dustless. Ragas + tar means to pass through the air, and in that sense only conquering the air. Geldner, Ved. Stud. p. 123, ignores the various shades of meaning in tur at the end of compounds.
Verse 8.
Note 1. Pâ´rye dyóh, according to Grassmann, 'on the decisive day,' like pâ´rye diví.
Verse 11.
Note 1. I have translated Rudrásya sûnúm by the son of Rudra. It is true that a single Marut, as the son of Rudra, is not mentioned; but on the other hand, one could hardly call the whole company of the Maruts, the mâruta scil. gana, the son of Rudra. In I, 64, 12, we have Rudrasya sûnu in one pâda, and mâruta gana in the next. The Ribhus also are called in the same line savasah napâtah, and indrasya sûno, IV, 37, 4. Here sûnu corresponds almost to the English offspring, only it is masculine.
Note 2. Giráyah may have been meant for giryah, a possible ablative of giri; see Lanman, p. 383. Ugrâ´h would then refer to â´pah, unless we break the sentence into two, viz. 'my bright thoughts tend to the host of heaven,' and the fierce Maruts strive like waters from the mountain.' If we compare, however, IX, 95, 3. apâ´m iva íd ûrmáyah tárturânâh prá manîshâ´h îrate sómam ákkha, we see that the whole verse forms one sentence. All would be right if we could change girayah into giribhyah, but is not this a conjecture nimis facilis?

"
35,"MANDALA VII, HYMN 56.","ASHTAKA V, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 23-26.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. Who are these resplendent men, dwelling together, the boys of Rudra, also 1 with good horses?
2. No one indeed knows their births, they alone know each other's birthplace.
3. They plucked each other with their beaks 1; the hawks, rushing like the wind, strove together.
4. A wise man understands these secrets 1, that Prisni, the great, bore an udder.
5. May that clan be rich in heroes by the Maruts, always victorious, rich in manhood!
6. They are quickest to go, most splendid with splendour, endowed with beauty, strong with strength.
7. Strong is your strength, steadfast your powers, and thus by the Maruts is this clan mighty.
8. Resplendent is your breath, furious are the minds of the wild host, like a shouting maniac 1.
9. Keep from us entirely your flame, let not your hatred reach us here.
10. I call on the dear names of your swift ones, so that the greedy should be satisfied 1, O Maruts,
11. The well-armed, the swift, decked with beautiful chains, who themselves adorn their bodies.
12. Bright are the libations for you, the bright ones, O Maruts, a bright sacrifice I prepare for the bright. In proper order came those who truly follow the order, the bright born, the bright, the pure.
13. On your shoulders, O Maruts, are the rings,
p. 374
on your chests the golden chains are fastened; far-shining like lightnings with showers 1, you wield your weapons, according to your wont.
14. Your hidden 1 splendours come forth; spread out your powers (names), O racers! Accept, O Maruts, this thousandfold, domestic share, as an offering for the house-gods 2.
15. If you thus listen, O Maruts, to this praise, at the invocation of the powerful sage, give him quickly a share of wealth in plentiful offspring, which no selfish enemy shall be able to hurt.
16. The Maruts, who are fleet like racers, the manly youths, shone like Yakshas 1; they are beautiful like boys standing round the hearth, they play about like calves who are still sucking.
17. May the bounteous Maruts be gracious to us, opening up to us the firm heaven and earth. May that bolt of yours which kills cattle and men, be far from us! Incline to us, O Vasus, with your favours.
18. The Hotri priest calls on you again and again, sitting down and praising your common gift, O Maruts. O strong ones, he who is the guardian of so much wealth, he calls on you with praises, free from guile.
19. These Maruts stop the swift, they bend strength by strength 1, they ward off the curse of the plotter, and turn 2 their heavy hatred on the enemy.
20. These Maruts stir up even the sluggard 1, even the vagrant 2, as the gods 3 pleased. O strong ones, drive away the darkness, and grant us all our kith and kin.
21. May we not fall away from your bounty, O
p. 375
[paragraph continues]
Maruts, may we not stay behind, O charioteers, in the distribution of your gifts. Let us share in the brilliant wealth, the well-acquired, that belongs to you, O strong ones.
22. When valiant men fiercely fight together, for rivers, plants, and houses 1, then, O Maruts, sons of Rudra, be in battles our protectors from the enemy.
23. O Maruts, you have valued 1 the praises which our fathers have formerly recited to you; with the Maruts the victor is terrible in battle, with the Maruts alone the racer wins the prize.
24. O Maruts, may we have a strong son, who is lord among men, a ruler, through whom we may cross the waters to dwell in safety, and then obtain our own home for you 1.
25. May Indra then, Varuna, Mitra, Agni, the waters, the plants, the trees of the forest be pleased with us. Let us be in the keeping, in the lap of the Maruts; protect us always with your favours.

Verse 1.
Note 1. The SV. reads athâ for the older adhâ. Sanîkâ in the edition of the Bibl. Ind. is a misprint for sanîlâ.
Verse 3.
Note 1. Sva-pû is explained by Roth as possibly a broom, raising the dust. Grassmann translates it by light, Ludwig by blowing. I suggest to take it for *vapû, in the sense of beak or claw, from vap, which follows immediately. See note to I, 88, 4. I do not see how the other meanings assigned to svapû give any sense. Oldenberg therefore suggests pavanta, 'Sie strömten hell auf einander zu mit ihren svapûs.'
Verse 4.
Note 1. Sâyana explains etâ´ni ninyâ´ by svetavarnâni marudâtmakâni bhûtâni. He takes ûdhas as a locative.
Verse 8.
Note 1. Geldner translates: 'Der Spielmann des wilden Heeres ist wie ein Muni,' and adds, 'Aber was ist ein Muni im Veda?'
Verse 10.
Note 1. I read tripán for tripát of the Pada text, and refer vâvasânâ´h to the Maruts. The TS. has tripát, and the commentary explains it by triptim. The first line is Virâg, the second Trishtubh, and the Trishtubh metre is afterwards carried on.
p. 377
Verse 11.
This verse refers to the Maruts, not, as Ludwig thinks, to the priests. Dr. v. Bradke (Dyaus Asura, p. 65) proposes to join verses 10 and 11 into one Trishtubh, and possibly to insert â´ before huve. I doubt whether for the present such changes are justified. On the structure of this hymn, see Oldenberg, Prol. 96, Anm. 3; 200, Anm. 5.
Verse 13.
Note 1. TB. II, 8, 5, 6, reads vyrishtibhih (not vrishtibhih), and the commentator explains, vyrishtibhir âyudhaviseshair vyrishtyâkhyair, viseshena rokamânâh sthitâh. And again, rishtaya eva visishtatvâd vyrishtaya ity ukyante. Bollensen, Z. D. M. G. XLI, 501, conjectures rishtibhih for vrishtibhih, which is very ingenious. See also note 1 to II, 34, 2.
Verse 14.
Note 1. Budhnyã, explained by budhne bhavâni, and also by kâlapravrittâni.
Note 2. Grihamedhîya may refer to the Maruts as grihamedhâs or grihamedhinas; see RV. VII, 59, 10; VS. XXIV, 16. The grihamedhîyâ ishti in Sat. Br. XI, 5, 2, 4, is meant for the Maruts.
Verse 16.
Note 1. Yakshadrísah is explained as wishing to see a sacrifice or feast. Ludwig retains this meaning. Grassmann translates, 'wie feurige Blitze funkeln.' Yaksha may mean a shooting star or any meteor, literally what shoots or hastens along; see VII, 61, 5. ná yâ´su kitrám dádrise ná yakshám; also note to V, 55, 1. But dris is not sadris. If we follow the later Sanskrit, yaksha would mean a class of spirits, followers of Kuvera, also ghosts in general. If this is not too modern a conception for the Rig-veda, we might translate yakshadris, 'appearing as ghosts' (see Kaus. Sûtra 95 in BR.), or, considering the expression átyah ná yamsat yakshabhrít víketâh, I, 190, 4, take it for a name of horses.
p. 378
Verse 19.
Note 1. Does not sáhasa â´ stand for sáhasâ â´, and not for sáhasah â´? Comp. Oldenberg, Prolegomena, 465 seq.
Note 2. On dadhanti, see Hübschmann, Indogerm. Vocal-system, p. 12.
Verse 20.
Note 1. On radhra, see Pischel, Ved. Stud. pp. 124 seq.
Note 2. Bhrimi is doubtful, but as it stands by the side of radhra, it seems to have a bad meaning, such as a vagrant, unsteady.
Note 3. The Vasus are often mentioned with the Âdityas and Rudras, see III, 8, 8; X, 66, 12; 128, 9. By themselves they became almost synonymous with the Devas. Thus in VII, ii, 4, we read that Agni became the master of all sacrifices, krátum hí asya Vásavah gushánta átha devâ´h dadhire havyavâ´ham, 'for the Vasus liked his wisdom, therefore the Devas made him the carrier of offerings.' See also V, 3, 10. pitâ´ Vaso yádi tát gosháyâse. In one passage, VI, 50, 4, Vasavah means the Maruts. In our passage it seems better to take it in the sense of gods, but we might also refer it to the Maruts.
Verse 22.
Note 1. With pâda b, compare VII, 70, 3 b.
Verse 23.
Note 1. I have taken bhû´ri kakra in the sense of magni facere, though I can find no analogous passages.
Verse 24.
Note 1. This verse has been well explained by Dr. v. Bradke, Dyaus Asura, p. 66. Svám ókah, our own home, occurs IV, 50, 8; V, 33, 4; VI, 41, 1; VIII, 72, 14. Abhyas means generally to obtain what is not our own. See also VII, 48, 2. Vah, which I have translated 'for you,' may also mean 'from you.'
Verse 25.
This verse is marked as a galita taken from VII, 34, 25, while the last pâda is a galita taken from VII, I, 25.

"
36,"MANDALA VII, HYMN 57.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods).,To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. O ye worshipful, your company of Maruts is fond of honey, they who delight in their strength at the sacrifices, the Maruts, who shake even the wide heaven and earth, and fill the well, when they move about, the terrible ones.
2. Truly the Maruts find out the man who praises them, and guide the thoughts of the sacrificer. Sit down then to rejoice to-day, on the altar 1 in our assemblies 2 well pleased.
3. Others do not shine so much as these Maruts with their golden chains, their weapons, and their own bodies; the all-adorned, adorning heaven and earth, brighten themselves with the same brightness, when starting for triumph.
4. May your shining thunderbolt be far from us, O Maruts, whatever sin we may commit against you, men as we are: O worshipful, let us not fall under 1 its power, let your best favour rest on us.
5. May the Maruts be pleased with whatever little we have done here, they the faultless, the bright, the pure. Protect us, ye worshipful, with your favours, lead us to prosperity through booty.
6. And let the manly Maruts, when they have been praised, under whatever names, enjoy these offerings! Grant that our offspring may not die 1, raise up for us riches 2, glory, and wealth.
7. O Maruts, when you have thus been praised, come all together with help towards our lords who with their hundredfold wealth freely prosper us;—protect us always with your favours!

NOTES.
Ascribed to Vasishtha. None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB., MS. Metre, Trishtubh.
Verse 1.
This hymn has been translated by Geldner and Kaegi. The first verse is most difficult. G.-K. avoid all difficulties by translating, 'Beim Fest des süssen Trankes weiss man tüchtig euch zu begeistern, hehre Schaar der Marut.' Ludwig grapples with them by translating; 'An eures madhu kraft, o zu vererende, freut bei den opfern sich der Marut geschlecht.' I doubt, however, whether savas is ever ascribed to madhu, though it is ascribed to Soma. Oldenberg suggests, ‘The sweet ones’ is your Marut-name, O worshipful, they who rejoice in their strength at the sacrifices.’ Here the difficulty would be that Mârutam nâma is the recognised term for the name, i. e. the kin of the Maruts. Still, unless we venture on a conjecture, this would seem to be the best rendering. Could we change mádhvah vah nâ´ma mâ´rutam into madhvád vah nâ´ma mâ´rutam? Madhvád is a Vedic word, though it occurs once only, in I, 164, 22, and as trisyllabic. Its very rarity would help to account for the change. The meaning would then be, 'your Marut kin eats honey, is fond of honey.'
It has been proved that the present mádati is always neutral, meaning to rejoice, while mand (Par.) is transitive, to make rejoice. Otherwise madhvah might possibly have been taken in the sense of sweet things, as in I, 180, 4; IX, 89, 3, and construed with madanti.

Verse 1.
Note 1. Dhâman is one of the cruces of translators, and it remains so after all that has been written on the subject by Bergaigne, III, 210 seq. There are many words in the Veda which it is simply impossible to translate, because their meaning has not yet been differentiated, and they convey such general or rather vague concepts that it is utterly impossible to match them in our modern languages. Translators are often blamed that they do not always render the same Vedic by the same English word. It would be simply impossible to do so, because, according to the different surroundings in which it occurs, the same word receives different shades of meaning which in English can only be approximately expressed by different words. Bergaigne is, no doubt, right when he says that dhâ-man is derived from dhâ, to set or settle, and that it therefore meant at first what is settled. From this he proceeds to argue that the original meaning of dhâman, from which all others are derived, is law. But law is a very late and very abstract word, and we must never forget that words always progress from the concrete to the abstract, from the material to the spiritual, and but seldom, and at a much later time, in an opposite direction. Now even if we were to admit that dhâman does not occur in the Veda in the sense of settlement, i. e. abode, this is certainly its most general meaning afterwards, and no one would maintain that a settlement, i. e. a household, was called dhâman, because it involved a settlement, i. e. laws. The same applies to vratá. Bergaigne (III, 213) agrees with me that vrata should be derived from var, to surround, to guard, and not from var, to choose, but he thinks that it meant at once 'garde, protection,'
p. 384
and not 'lieu clos.' I still hold that like νομός, vrata must have meant first a real hedge, or ἕρκος, and then only an abstract enclosure, i. e. a law, νόμος. In this case we can see the actual transition of thought. People would begin by saying, 'there is a fence here against your cattle,' and this would in time assume the meaning 'there is a defence against your cattle straying on my meadow.' But it would be impossible to begin, as Bergaigne (p. 216) does, with the abstract meaning of protection, law, and then return and use the word in such phrases as V, 46, 7. apâ´m vraté, 'within the pale of the waters.'
Dhâman, therefore, meant originally, I still believe, what was actually laid down or settled, hence an abode. When, as in the Veda, it means law, I do not say that this was necessarily derived from the meaning of abode. I only maintain that it was a second, if not a secondary, meaning, and that, at all events, the meaning of abode cannot be derived from that of law.
After dhâman meant what is settled, it has sometimes to be translated by law, by nature, sometimes by class, or clan, where it comes very near to nâman, name, while sometimes it may best be rendered by a general and abstract suffix, or even by a plural. Thus in our passage, daívyasya dhâ´mnah is not very different from devânâm.
What is peculiar to our passage is the genitive governed by tuvishmân. After all the learning which Bergaigne has expended on the analysis of dhâman, he does not help us to a translation of our sentence. If we translate 'of the divine law, powerful,' we have words, but no sense. I take daívyasya dhâ´mnah as a genitivus partitivus, such as AV. IV, 37, 5. óshadhînâm vîrúdhâm vîryẫvati:. See Kuhn, Zeitschrift XIII, 120; Siecke, Genitivus, p. 14. Grassmann: 'Die mächtig walten in der Götter Wohnsitz.' Ludwig: 'Die von göttlicher natur, die starke.' He denies that tuvishmân could be followed by the genitive. I do not maintain that I am satisfied on that point. All I say in this as in many other cases is that my translation gives something which we can understand. Let others give us something better.

The text in the AV. VII, 77, 2, is bad, yó no márto maruto durhrinâyús, práti muñkatâm sáh, and tápasâ for hánmanâ. The TS. IV, 3, 13, 3, has tiráh satyâ´ni. It reads besides, yó no márto vasavo durhrinâyús tiráh satyâ´ni marutah gíghâm̐sât druháh pâ´sam, and tápasâ. Tiráh kittâ´ni may mean 'beyond all conception,' as Grassmann takes it, or 'unobserved,' as B.-R. suggest. Tiráh satyâ´ni might mean 'in spite of all pledges,' but that is probably an emendation. All this shows the unsettled state of Vedic tradition, outside that of the Rig-veda; see Oldenberg, Prolegomena, p. 328.

Note 1. Tryambaka is a name of Rudra, but its original meaning is doubtful. Some commentators explain it by 'three-eyed,' but its natural meaning would be 'having three mothers.' The Sat. Br. II, 6, 2, 9, derives it from Stry-ambikâ, because Ambikâ, Rudra's sister, shares the sacrifice with him.

All scholars seem to agree that this hymn is a composite hymn, and that it breaks the law of decrease in the number of verses. It begins with three Pragâthas, verses 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, which may be in their right place. Then follow two Trishtubhs, 7 and 8, which may form a hymn by themselves. The next three Gâyatrîs, which clearly belong together, are a later addition; so is the last verse, which ought to stand in the Atharva rather than in the Rig-veda. The Pada text does not divide this last verse. See on this subject, Oldenberg, Z. D. M. G. XXXVIII, 449 seq., Proleg. 200; 511; Bergaigne, Recherches sur l’histoire de la Samhitâ, II, 10.

Verse 1.
Note 1. Trishtúbham is an adjective belonging to ísham. The same expression occurs again, VIII, 69, 1, as a galita, and is therefore of little help. In IX, 62, 24, the íshah are called parishtúbhah, which seems to mean something like parisrut, i. e. standing round about. I therefore take trishtubh in our passage simply as threefold, referring probably to the morning, noon, and evening sacrifice. The sacrifice is often called trivrit, X, 52, 4; 124, 1. Some scholars ascribe to stubh in trishtubh the meaning of liturgical shouting.
Verse 2.
Note 1. Besides ní ahâsata, we find úd ahâsata, I, 9, 4, and ápa ahâsata, IX, 73, 6. On ki, see verse 14, and V, 55, 7. It is often impossible to say whether the Vedic Aorist should be translated in English by the perfect or the imperfect. If we take the verse as describing an historical fact, it would be, 'When you saw your way, or, as soon as you had seen your way, the clouds fell.' If it is meant as a repeated event, it would be, 'when, i. e. whenever you have seen your way, the clouds have fallen.' The difficulty lies in English, and though the grammars lay down rules, usage does not conform to them. The difference in the use of tenses in English is so great that in the revised version of the Bible, a number of passages had to be translated differently for the English and for the American public. Thus in Rom. ii. 12, the English edition gives, 'For as many as have sinned without law, shall perish without law.' The American edition changes this into 'As many as sinned without the law.' Gal. iii. 22, English: 'The scripture hath shut up;' American: 'The scripture shut up.' It was on account of this and other changes of
p. 395
idiom which have sprung up between English and American, that different editions of the revised version had actually to be printed for England and America. No wonder, therefore, that an American critic should in his innocence have charged me with not knowing the difference between the aorist, the imperfect, and the perfect in Vedic Sanskrit!
Verse 7.
Note 1. Arunapsu, perhaps reddish-coloured, an epithet of the dawn. here applied to the Maruts. The Maruts are sometimes called vrishapsu, ahrutapsu, I, 52, 4; VIII, 20, 7.
Verse 8.
Note 1. The relation between the light cast forth by the Maruts and the path of the sun is not quite clear, except that in other places also the Maruts are connected with the morning. The darkness preceding a thunderstorm may be identified with the darkness of the night, preceding the sunrise. See Bergaigne, II, 379 seq.
Verse 9.
Note 1. The meaning of ribhukshan is doubtful. It is applied to Indra and the Maruts. See Bergaigne, II, 403; 404 note; 412.
Verse 10.
Note 1. The Prisnis in the plural fem. are the clouds, see VIII, 6, 19. Mythologically there is but one Prisni, the mother of the Maruts. See also Bergaigne, II, 397.
Note 2. I am doubtful about the three lakes of Madhu, here of rain, poured from their udders by the clouds. The number three is common enough, and Ludwig has pointed out a parallel passage from the AV. X, 10, 10-12, where we read of three pâtras, filled with milk and Soma. Many similar passages have been collected by Bergaigne, I, 177, but again without a definite result. The question is whether the three words utsa, kavandha, and udrin are meant as names of the three pâtras, in our passage, of the three lakes, or whether they should be taken as an apposition,
p. 396
the three lakes, namely, the well (of the sky), the skin full of water, and udrin, the watering-pot. Udrin is elsewhere an adjective only, but I think we must here translate, 'the well, the water-skin, the watering-pot.'
Verse 12.

Note 1. I have ventured to translate drapsâh by torrents. Neither drops nor sparks nor banners seem to yield an appropriate simile, but I feel very doubtful. See VIII, 96, 13; IX, 73, 1.
Verse 22.
Note 1. I thought at first that by sám parvasáh dadhuh was meant the mixing or confounding together of heaven and earth; it being impossible, during a storm, to distinguish the two. But there is clearly, as Ludwig points out, an opposition between sám dadhuh and ví yayuh. I therefore take parvasáh in verse 22 in the sense of piece by piece, as in AV. IV, 12, 7. sám dadhat párushâ páruh, while in verse 23 it means in pieces.
Verse 25.
Note 1. On siprâh, see note to II, 34, 3.
Verse 26.
Note 1. Ukshnáh rándhram, 'the hollow of the bull,' whatever that may be, is not mentioned again. If it is meant for
p. 397
the dark cloud which hides the rain, then the roar of the bull would be the thunder of the cloud, stirred by the Maruts. Aukshnorandhra, however, is the technical name of certain Sâmans, so that Ukshnorandhra may have been, like Usanâ (later Usanas), a proper name. See Tândya Br. XIII, 9, 18; 19.
Note 2. If usánâ stands for usanayâ it might mean, 'with desire,' but it seems more likely that it refers to the Rishi, who is called Usanâ in the Rig-veda, and Usanas in later writings. See Lanman, p. 562, l. 21; Bergaigne, II, 338, n. 3; Schmidt, K. Z. XXVI, 402, n. 1.
Verse 27.
Note 1. On makhásya dâváne, see note to I, 6, 8, where I accepted the old explanation, 'Come to the offering of the priest.' But does makha mean priest? In later Sanskrit it means sacrifice, so that makhásya dâváne has been translated, 'for the offering of the sacrifice,' that is, 'that we may be able to offer you sacrifice.' If makha means glad and refers to Soma, which is doubtful, the sense would be the same. Possibly dâváne may here be derived from do, to divide, but this would not help us much.
Verse 28.
The AV. reads yám tvâ príshatî ráthe práshtir váhati rohita, subhâ´ yâsi rinánn apáh, which yields no help.
Verse 29.
This verse is very difficult. First of all, níkakrayâ can hardly mean 'without a chariot' (B.-R.), but seems an adverb, meaning downwards. But the chief difficulty lies in this, that we must decide, once for all, whether words, such as sushoma, saryanâvat, ârgîka, pastyâvat, &c., are to be interpreted in their natural sense, as expressing localities, well known to the poet, or in their technical sense, as names of sacrificial vessels. That this decision is by no means easy, may be inferred from the fact that two scholars, Roth and Ludwig, differ completely, the former preferring the technical, the latter the geographical meaning. We must
p. 398
remember that in the hymns to the Maruts the poets speak occasionally of the countries, far and near, visited by the storm-winds. We must also bear in mind that in our very passage the poet asks the Maruts to come to him, and not to tarry with other people. When, therefore, he says, that they went to Saryanâvat, &c., is that likely to be meant for a tank of Soma at his own or any other sacrifice?
Saryanâvat is derived from sarya, this from sara. Sara means reed, arrow; sarya, made of reeds, saryâ, an arrow, but also reeds tied together and used at the sacrifice for carrying Soma-oblations. From it, saryana, which, according to Sâyana, means lands in Kurukshetra (RV. VIII, 6, 39), and from which Saryanâvat is derived, as the name of a lake in that neighbourhood (not a Landstrich, B.-R.). When this saryanâvat occurs in the Rig-veda, the question is, does it mean that lake, evidently a famous lake and a holy place in the early settlements of the Vedic Âryas, or does it mean, as others suppose, a sacrificial vessel made of reeds? It occurs in the Rig-veda seven times.
In I, 84, 14, Indra is said to have found the head of the horse, which had been removed among the mountains (clouds) at Saryanâvat. This seems to me the lake in which the sun sets. In the 8th Mandala saryanâvat occurs three times. In VIII, 6, 39, Indra is invoked to rejoice at Saryanâvat, or, according to others, in a vessel full of Soma. In our passage the Maruts went to Saryanâvat, to Sushoma, Ârgîka, and Pastyâvat, countries, it would seem, not vessels. In VIII, 64, it, after saying that the Soma had been prepared among the Pûrus, it is added that the Soma is sweetest in Saryanâvat, on the Sushomâ, and in Ârgîkîya. In IX, 65, 22, we read of Somas prepared far and near, and at Saryanâvat, and in the next verse we read of Somas to be found either among the Ârgîkas, among the Pastyâs, or among the Five Tribes. In IX, 113, 1; 2, Indra is asked to drink Soma at Saryanâvat, and the Soma is asked to come from Ârgîka. In X, 35, 2, the aid is implored of heaven and earth, of the rivers and the mountains, and these mountains are called saryanâvatah.
p. 399
[paragraph continues]
Ârgîkîya, besides the three passages mentioned already, occurs X, 75, 5, where it is clearly a river as well as Sushomâ, while in IX, 65, 23, the Ârgîkas, in the plural, could only be the name of a people.
Taking all this into account, it seems to me that we ought to accept the tradition that Saryanâvat was a lake and the adjoining district in Kurukshetra, that Ârgîka was the name of a river, Ârgîka the name of the adjoining country, Ârgîkâh, of the inhabitants, Ârgîkîyâ another name of Ârgîkâ, the river, and Ârgîkîyam another name of the country Ârgîka. Sushoma in our passage is probably the name of the country near the Sushomâ, and Pastyâvat, though it might be an adjective meaning filled with hamlets, is probably another geographical name; see, however, IX, 65, 23. Ludwig takes Saryanâvat as a name of the Eastern Sarasvatî; see Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 19; but we should expect Saryanâvatî as the name of a river. See also Bergaigne, I, 206, who, according to his system, takes all these names as 'préparateurs célestes du Soma.'
Verse 31.
See I, 38, 1, note 1.
Verse 36.
Note 1. Sâyana may be right in stating that this verse was intended for an Âgnimâruta sacrifice, and that therefore Agni was praised first, and afterwards the Maruts. In that case pûrvya might mean first.
Note 2. Khandas is doubtful; see, however, I, 92, 6.

"
40,"MANDALA VIII, HYMN 20.","ASHTAKA VI, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 36-40.",To the Maruts (the Storm-gods),"1. Come hither, do not fail, when you march forward! Do not stay away, O united friends, you who can bend even what is firm.
2. O Maruts, Ribhukshans, come hither on your flaming strong fellies 1, O Rudras, come to us to-day with food, you much-desired ones, come to the sacrifice, you friends of the Sobharis 2.
3. For we know indeed the terrible strength of the sons of Rudra, of the vigorous Maruts, the liberal givers 1 of Soma 2 (rain).
4. The islands (clouds) were scattered, but the monster remained 1, heaven and earth were joined together. O you who are armed with bright rings, the tracts (of the sky) 2 expanded, whenever you stir, radiant with your own splendour.
5. Even things that cannot be thrown down resound at your race, the mountains, the lord of the forest,—the earth quivers on your marches.
6. The upper sky makes wide room, to let your violence pass, O Maruts, when these strong-armed heroes display their energies in their own bodies.
7. According to their wont these men, exceeding terrible, impetuous, with strong and unbending forms 1, bring with them beautiful light 2.
8. The arrow of the Sobharis is shot from the bowstrings at the golden chest on the chariot of the Maruts 1. They, the kindred of the cow (Prisni),
p. 401
the well-born, should enjoy their food, the great ones should help us.
9. Bring forward, O strongly-anointed 1 (priests), your libations to the strong host of the Maruts, the strongly advancing.
10. O Maruts, O heroes, come quickly hither, like winged hawks, on your chariot with strong horses, of strong shape, with strong naves, to enjoy our libations.
11. Their anointing is the same, the golden chains shine on their arms, their spears sparkle.
12. These strong, manly, strong-armed Maruts, do not strive among themselves; firm are the bows, the weapons on your chariot, and on your faces are splendours.
13. They whose terrible name 1, wide-spreading like the ocean, is the one of all that is of use, whose strength is like the vigour of their father,
14. Worship these Maruts, and praise them! Of these shouters, as of moving spokes 1, no one is the last; this is theirs by gift, by greatness 2 is it theirs.
15. Happy is he who was under your protection, O Maruts, in former mornings, or who may be so even now.
16. Or he, O men, whose libations you went to enjoy; that mighty one, O shakers, will obtain your favours with brilliant riches and booty.
17. As the sons of Rudra, the servants of the divine Dyu 1, win it, O youths, so shall it be.
18. Whatever liberal givers may worship 1 the Maruts, and move about together as generous 2 benefactors, even from them turn 3 towards us with a kinder heart, you youths
19. O Sobhari, call loud with your newest song
p. 402
the young, strong, and pure Maruts, as the plougher calls the cows.
20. Worship the Maruts with a song, they who are strong like a boxer, called in to assist those who call 1 for him in all fights; (worship them) the most glorious, like bright-shining bulls.
21. Yes, O united friends, kindred, O Maruts, by a common birth, the oxen lick one another's humps 1.
22. O ye dancers, with golden ornaments on your chests, even a mortal comes (to ask) for your brotherhood 1; take care of us, ye Maruts, for your friendship lasts for ever.
23. O bounteous Maruts, bring us some of your Marut-medicine, you friends, and (quick, like) steeds.
24. With the favours whereby you favour the Sindhu, whereby you save, whereby you help Krivi 1, with those propitious favours be our delight, O delightful ones, ye who never hate your followers 2.
25. O Maruts, for whom we have prepared good altars, whatever medicine 1 there is on the Sindhu, on the Asiknî, in the seas, on the mountains,
26. Seeing it, you carry it all on your bodies. Bless us with it! Down to the earth, O Maruts 1, what hurts our sick one,—straighten what is crooked!

NOTES.
Ascribed to Sobhari Kânva; metre, Kâkubha pragâtha. Verse 1 = SV. I, 401; verse 21 = SV. I, 404.
Verse 1.
SV. reads sthâta, and dridhâ kid yamayishnavah.
Verse 2.
Note 1. It might be better to supply rathaih, but the poet may have used pars pro toto.
Note 2. The Sobharis, who are mentioned in the 8th Mandala only, are clearly a clan of that name, and their hymns form a small collection by itself. See Oldenberg. Prolegomena, p. 209 seq.
Verse 3.
Note 1. Mîlhvas is sometimes used by itself in the sense of patron or benefactor, VII, 86, 7; 97, 2. Whether it can govern a genitive is doubtful, but see VII, 58, 5, note.
Note 2. Here again, as in II, 34, 11, Vishnu esha seems to mean Soma, possibly the food, or even the seed (retas) of Vishnu. Sâyana too takes Vishnu as a name of rain. In I, 154, 5, we read that the spring of madhu is in the highest place of Vishnu. Could it mean the generous sons of Vishnu?
Verse 4.
Note 1. My translation is purely conjectural. I take dvîpa for isolated or scattered clouds, different from the dukkhunâ, which I take for the black mass of storm-clouds, threatening destruction. Grassmann: 'Die Wolkeninseln stoben and das Unheil floh.' Ludwig: 'Empor stigen gewaltig die waszerinseln, still stand das unglück.'
Note 2. The coming together of heaven and earth and their apparent widening have been ascribed to the Maruts before. It seems hardly possible to translate dhanvâni here by bows. I take it for the wide expanse, as if the desert, of the sky.
p. 404
Verse 7.
Note 1. On psu in vrishapsu, see note to VIII, 7, 7.
Note 2. Possibly sríyam váhante has to be taken like subham yâ, see Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 163.
Verse 8.
Note 1. In support of the translation which I proposed in I, 85, 10, note 2, all I can say is that ag is a verb used for shooting forth an arrow, see I, 112, 16, and that vâna may be used in the sense of bâna, reed and arrow, and that go is used for bowstring, see B.-R. s. v. The question, however, arises, how does this verse come in here? How does the fact that the Sobharis, who are praising the storm-gods, shoot their arrow at the golden chest on their chariot, agree with what precedes and follows?
Let us look first whether a more natural translation can be found. B.-R. translate: 'The sacrificial music of the Sobharis is furnished and therefore made more attractive by draughts of milk (or animal food).' In order to support such a translation, it should be proved, first, that vâna ever means sacrificial music, and that such sacrificial music can be spoken of as agyate (it is furnished), gobhih (by milk-draughts). Grassmann translates: 'Durch Milchtrank wird der Sobharis Musik belohnt.' Here again it must be proved that vâna can mean sacrificial music, and agyate, it is rewarded. Ludwig translates: 'Mit der milch wird gesalbt den Sobhari der zapfen am wagen am goldnen korbe.' This is explained to mean that 'the bolt on the chariot of the Maruts is to be greased with milk, so that the milk may stream down on the Sobharis.' I doubt whether vâna can mean bolt, and I do not see that the intention of the poet, namely to ask for rain, would be conveyed by such words.
Sâyana interprets: 'Through the cows, i. e. the hymns, of the Sobharis the lyre of the Maruts is made evident;' or; 'by the cows, i. e. the Maruts, the lyre is manifested for the sake of the Sobharis.'
In support of my own translation I can only appeal to a
p. 405
custom ascribed by Herodotus (IV, 94) to another ancient Aryan tribe, namely the Thracians, who, when there is thunder and lightning, shoot arrows against the sky. Herodotus in trying to find a motive for this says they do it to threaten the god. because they believe in no other god, but their own. This may be so; the only question is whether in shooting their arrows against the sky, they hoped to drive the clouds away, or wished them to give up their treasure, namely the rain. I should feel inclined to take the latter view, but in either case we see that what the Thracians did, was exactly what the Sobharis are said to do here, namely to shoot an arrow at the golden chest or treasure on the chariot of the Maruts. This is, of course. no more than a conjecture, and I shall gladly give it up, if a more appropriate meaning can be elicited from this line. What is against it is the frequent occurrence of añg with gobhih in the sense of covering with milk, see IX, 45, 3: V, 3, 2, &c. As to ráthe kóse hiranyáye, see VIII, 22, 9.
Verse 9.
Note 1. Vrishad-añgayah for vrishan-añgayah, see J. Schmidt, K. Z. XXVI, 358. It cannot mean 'raining down ointments,' as Grassmann supposes, because that would be varshad-añgayah, if it existed at all. Besides. the añgis are never poured down, nor are they sacrificial viands. The repetition of the word vrishan is intentional. and has been discussed before.
Verse 13.
Note 1. Nâman is, of course, more than the mere name; but name can be used in much the same sense.
Verse 14.
Note 1. The simile of the aras, as in V, 58, 5, seems to require another negative.
Note 2. See V, 87, 2, on dânâ´ and mahnâ´.
Verse 17.
Note 1. On diváh ásurasya vedhásah, see von Bradke. Dyaus Asura, pp. 44 and 46. It should be remembered,
p. 406
however, that vedhas and medhas interchange. Thus in RV. IX, 102, 4, we have vedhâ´m, in SV. I, 101, medhâ´m. On medhâs, the Zend mazdâ, see Darmesteter, Ormazd, p. 29. I take servant in the sense of worshipper, from vidh.
Verse 18.
Note 1. Arhanti, in the sense of arhayanti, to worship, seems better than to be worthy of, or to have a right to.
Note 2. Mîlhúshah can be nominative, see Lanman, p. 511; but it may also refer to the Maruts, and then be accusative.
Note 3. Instead of â´ vavridhvam, which Ludwig translates, Nemt uns für euch in besitz, Grassmann translates, Wendet euch zu uns her. He read therefore â´ vavriddhvam, and this, the plural corresponding to â´ vavritsva, seems to be the right reading.
Verse 20.
Note 1. Grassmann proposes to change pritsú hótrishu into yutsú pritsúshu. But may not hótrishu be used here in a sense corresponding to that of hávya? Hávya has almost the technical meaning of an ally who is to be called for assistance. Thus IV, 24, 2. sáh vritrahátye hávyah; VII, 32, 24. bháre-bhare ka hávyah, &c. Now a hávyah, one who is called, presupposes a hótri, one who calls for assistance. It is true that hotri, from hu, to pour out, has so completely become a technical name that it seems strange to see it used here, in a new etymological sense, as caller. But the connection with havya may justify what may have been meant as a play on the words. Wilson seems to have taken the verse in a similar sense, when he translates: 'and like a boxer who has been challenged over his challengers.' He, like Ludwig, takes hotri as a challenger. I prefer to take it as calling for aid. I am not satisfied, however, with either translation, nor does Grassmann or Ludwig offer anything useful.
Verse 21.
Note 1. In the SV. marútah and riháte have the accent
p. 407
on the second syllable. Sábandhavah was used before of the Maruts, V, 59, 5; according to its accent it would here refer to gâ´vah. I can see no meaning in this verse except a very naturalistic one, namely that the Maruts, who are described as friends and brothers, as never quarrelling and always of one mind, are here compared to oxen, grazing in the same field, and so far from fighting, actually licking the humps on each other's backs.
Verse 22.
Note 1. Grassmann, 'geht euch an um eure Brüderschaft;' possibly, 'becomes your brother.'
Verse 24.
Note 1. It is, no doubt, very tempting to change tû´rvatha into turvásam, as Ludwig proposes. The difficulty is to understand how such a change should have come about. Sindhu may mean here, not so much the river, as the people living on its shores. Krivi is said to be an old name of the Pañkâlas (Sat. Br. XIII, 5, 4, 7). But, because the Pañkâlas were called Krivis, and because in later times we often hear of Kuru-Pañkâlas, it does in no way follow that the Krivis were identical with the Kurus. It proves rather the contrary. Kuru may be derived from kar, and may have meant active, but it may also have had a very different original meaning. A derivation of krivi from kar is still more objectionable.
Note 2. Asakadvishah, which I translate by not hating your followers, is translated by Ludwig: 'ihr, denen kein haszer folgt.' It may also be rendered by hating those who do not follow you.'
Verse 25.
Note 1. The medicines are generally brought by Rudra, and by his sons, the Maruts.
Verse 26.

2. She in whose lap 1 all gods observe their duties, sun and moon (also), that they may be seen;
3. Therefore all our friends 1, the singers, invite the Maruts always, to drink (our) Soma.
4. This Soma here has been prepared, the Maruts drink of it, the Asvins also drink of the lord (Soma) 1.
5. Mitra, Aryaman, Varuna drink of the Soma which is continually 1 clarified, dwelling in three abodes 2, procuring offspring.
6. May Indra also rejoice to his satisfaction in this pressed juice, mixed with milk, like a Hotri 1 at the morning-sacrifice.
7. Did the brilliant lords flare up? Endowed with pure strength they rush, like water, through their enemies.
8. Shall I now choose the favour of you, the great gods, who by yourselves shine forth marvellously,

NOTES.
Ascribed to Bindu or Pûtadaksha. Metre, Gâyatrî. Verse 1 = SV. I, 149; verse 4 = SV. I, 174; II, 1135; verse 5. = SV. II, 1136; verse 6 = SV. II, 1137. The whole hymn can easily be divided into trikas.
Verse 1.
Note 1. I adopt Ludwig's correction of the Pada, changing váhnih to váhnî iti, though it interrupts somewhat the connection between the first and second verses. Still it seems as impossible to change Prisni, the mother of the Maruts, into a cart-horse as into a sucking-calf. This we should have to do, if we took dhayati in its usual sense of sucking. Still dhayati means to suck, not to suckle. The commentary to the SV. explains vahnih as vodhrî, the driver.
Verse 2.
Note 1. I should prefer to take upásthe in the sense of proximity, which, as in the case of vrikshopasthe, may be translated by shadow, or protection.
Verse 3.
Note 1. I cannot believe that we can take aryá â´ in our passage as aryé â´, and translate it with Pischel (Z. D. M. G. XL, p. 125) by 'our singers among the Aryas.' With the plural kârávah we should expect aryéshu â´, not aryé â´; sec also Bergaigne, III, 287; II, 218. Pâda a and b are galita, see VI, 45, 33.
Verse 4.
Note 1. Svarâg seems to be meant for Soma as lord, not as brilliant.
Verse 5.
Note 1. Tánâ is generally explained by ûrnâstukanirmita dasâpavitra; see also Bergaigne, I, 179.
Note 2. The three abodes are either the morning. noon,
p. 411
and evening sacrifices, or the three Soma-vessels, the Dronakalasa, Âdhavanîya, and Pûtabhrit.
Verse 6.
Note 1. I do not see why hótâ-iva should not mean 'like the priest,' for the priest also rejoices in the libation; see Arthasamgraha, ed. Thibaut, pp. 10 and 20. Ludwig prefers to take hótâ for Agni, fire.

I have praised the goodly host of the Maruts 3, so that they may be worthy of a Brahman 4 so that they may be glorious.
2. These boys have prepared their ornaments for beauty, the goodly host of the Maruts, through many nights; the sons of Dyu struggled, like harts, they, the Âdityas, grew high, like banners 1.
3. They who by their own might seem to have risen above heaven and earth, like the sun above the cloud, they are glorious, like brilliant heroes, they shine forth like foe-destroying youths.
4. When you move along on the bottom of the waters, the earth seems to break and to melt 1. This perfect sacrifice is meet for you, come hither together, as if enjoying our offerings.
5. You are as drivers 1 on the poles with their reins, and as brilliant with light at daybreak; like hawks, you are famous destroyers of foes; like wells 2 springing forth, you scatter moisture.
6. When you, O Maruts, come from afar, knowing the great treasure of the hidden place, O Vasus, the treasure which has to be gained, then keep away also from afar all who hate us.
7. The man who, firm in his sacrifice, offers gifts to the Maruts to the end of the ceremony 1, he

Ascribed to Syûmarasmi Bhârgava. On the metre, see Rig-veda, translation, Introd. p. civ; Benfey, Quantitätsversch. IV, 2; 38-39; Oldenberg, Prolegomena, 92. This hymn and the next belong closely together. They are both so artificial and obscure that a translation of them can only be tentative. None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB., MS.
Verse 1.
Note 1. I take prushâ for prushâni.
Note 2. I do not think that abhraprúshah can be meant for the Maruts.
Note 3. The ná in many of the verses seems to be due to a mere trick, and untranslatable.
Note 4. Or, 'I have praised the priestly host, so that they may be worthy of good Marut-hood.'
Verse 2.
Note 1. Akrâ´h, banners, Grassmann; columns, Ludwig. The meaning is utterly unknown.
Verse 4.
Note 1. See Aurel Mayr, Beiträge aus dem Rig-Veda. p. 12. 'The earth melted,' see Ps. xlvi. 6.
Verse 5.
Note 1. Prayug seems to mean here a driver; pra-yug is often used of the Maruts as harnessing or driving their horses; see I, 85, 5; V, 52, 8.
Note 2. Prava has been derived from pru, to float. I should prefer to derive it from pra-van, from which we have pra-vana, precipice, possibly the Latin adjective pronus, and, very irregularly, Greek πρηνής. Stems in radical n frequently enter the class of stems in â and a, and pravan would become pravâh or pravah, as -gan becomes -gâh and -gah; cf. Lanman,
p. 415
p. 478. Others take vana for a mere suffix like vat. Prava, rushing forward, would have been a good name for a spring. This, of course, is a mere conjecture. Others derive pravâ-s from vâ, to blow. As a substantive pravâ as well as upavâ occurs AV. XII, 1, 51. vâ´tasya pravâ´m upavâ´m ánu vâty arkíh. But these words mean the blowing before and the blowing after, and not blowers. There are the verbs pravâ and anuvâ in Tândya Br. I, 9, 7; TS. III, 5, 2, 3; IV, 4, 1, 1. They are there referred to dawn and night. These passages, however, seem too technical to allow us to fix the original meaning of prava-h. Pravâ in RV. I, 34, 8, remains unexplained.

Verse 4.
Note 1. Ghritaprush, Fett sprühend, Gluth austheilend, according to Grassmann; ghrita-sprühend, according to Ludwig. Sâyana takes vareyávah as wishing to give presents, and explains that such gifts were preceded by a gift of water, so that ghritaprúshah would mean, giving water or rain. The real meaning is difficult.
Verse 5.
Note 1. Visvarûpa may have been meant in a more special and mythological sense.
Verse 6.
Note 1. Síndhu-mâtarah may be a synonym of Prisni-mâtarah, sindhu being used as a name of the water in the sky. It may also mean, having the river Sindhu for their mother, i. e. coming from the region of the river. Bergaigne translates (II, 397), 'qui ont pour mère la rivière céleste. Cette rivière peut être une des formes de la vache qui passe aussi pour leur mère.'

Verse 3.
Note 1. The vísve sagóshasah, following on Rudra, can hardly be meant for any but the Maruts, who are often called sagóshasah. But it may also have been intended for all the gods together.
Verse 4.
Note 1. Gâthápatim and medhápatim are both difficult. We expect gâthâ´patim and medhâ´patim. If, as Ludwig maintains, gâtha in Zend is equivalent to ritu, season, then gâthapati might be ritupati, a name of Agni, X, 2, 1. But this is extremely doubtful. We must derive gâthápati from gâthă, I, 167, 6, and medhápati from medhă, animal sacrifice, till we know more on the subject.
Note 2. Gálâsha-bheshagam, an epithet of Rudra; see VIII, 29, 5, where Rudra is intended. In II, 33, 7, the arm of Rudra is called bheshagáh gálâshah; in VII, 35, 6, Rudra himself is called gálâshah. Gálâsha seems connected with gala, water. Bergaigne, III, 32, translates it by adoucissant.
Note 3. On samyóh, see note 2 to I, 165, 4.

Verse 7.
Note 1. Tuvi-nrimna would seem more appropriate as a vocative. In verse 8, too, I should prefer to take Soma as a vocative, like Benfey and Grassmann.
Verse 8.
Note 1. I read Soma, paribâ´dhah. See Delbrück, Synt. Forsch. p. 116.
Verse 9.
Note 1. Unless we can take mûrdhâ´ for a locative, attracted by nâ´bhâ, I should propose to read mûrdhán nâ´bhâ. It can hardly be an adverbial Dvandva, mûrdhâ-nâbhâ, nor do I see how it can be applied as a nominative to Rudra. The whole verse is difficult, possibly a later addition. On ritásya amrítasya dhâ´man, see IX, 97, 32; 110, 4 (dhárman).

45,"MANDALA I, HYMN 114.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 5-6.",To Rudra,"1. We offer these prayers 1 to Rudra, the strong, whose hair is braided 2, who rules over heroes 3, that he may be a blessing to man and beast, that everything in this our village may be prosperous and free from disease.
2. Be gracious to us, O Rudra, and give us joy, and we shall honour thee, the ruler of heroes, with worship. What health and wealth father Manu acquired by his sacrifices, may we obtain the same, O Rudra, under thy guidance.
3. O bounteous Rudra, may we by sacrifice obtain the goodwill of thee, the ruler of heroes; come to our clans, well-disposed, and, with unharmed men, we shall offer our libation to thee.
4. We call down for our help the fierce Rudra, who fulfils our sacrifice, the swift, the wise; may he drive far away from us the anger of the gods; we desire his goodwill only.
5. We call down with worship the red boar of the sky, the god with braided hair, the blazing form; may he who carries in his hand the best medicines grant us protection, shield, and shelter!
6. This speech is spoken for the father of the Maruts, sweeter than sweet, a joy 1 to Rudra; grant to us also, O immortal, the food of mortals, be gracious to us and to our kith and kin!
7. Do not slay our great or our small ones, our

growing or our grown ones, our father or our mother and do not hurt our own 1 bodies, O Rudra!
8. O Rudra, hurt us not in our kith and kin, nor in our own life, not in our cows, nor in our horses! Do not slay our men in thy wrath: carrying libations, we call on thee always.
9. Like a shepherd 1, I have driven these praises near to thee; O father of the Maruts, grant us thy favour! For thy goodwill is auspicious, and most gracious, hence we desire thy protection alone.
10. Let thy cow-slaying and thy man-slaying be far away 1, and let thy favour be with us, O ruler of heroes! Be gracious to us, and bless us, O god, and then give us twofold protection 2.
11. We have uttered our supplication to him, desiring his help; may Rudra with the Maruts hear our call. May Mitra, Varuna, Aditi, the River, Earth, and the Sky grant us this!

Verse 1.
Note 1. TS. reads imâ´m matím, and yáthâ nah sám.
Note 2. Kapardin is an epithet not only of Rudra, but also of Pûshan (VI, 55, 2; IX, 67, II), and of a Vedic clan, the Tritsus (VII, 83, 8) or Vasishthas; see Roth, Zur Literatur and Geschichte des Weda, pp. 94 seq.; Oldenberg, Z. D. M. G. XLII, p. 207. Kaparda is the name of a shell, and the hair twisted together in the form of a shell seems to have suggested the name of kapardin.
Note 3. Kshayád-vîra means 'ruling over heroes,' just as mandád-vîra (VIII, 69, 1) means 'delighting heroes.' This meaning is applicable to all passages where kshayád-vîra occurs, and there is no reason why we should translate it by 'destroyer of heroes,' which can hardly be considered as an epitheton ornans. No doubt, a god who rules and protects can also be conceived as punishing and destroying, and this is particularly the case with Rudra. Hence in certain passages Rudra may well be invoked as nrihán (IV 3, 6), just as we read of the Maruts (VII, 56, 17): 'May that bolt of yours which kills cattle and men be far from us! Incline to us, O Vasu, with your favours!' See Muir, ST. IV, p. 301, note.

See Colebrooke, Misc. Ess. I, p. 141 (ed. 1837); and Svetâsvat. Up. in S. B. E. XV, p. 254, note. Â´yushi for âyaú is supported by VS. and TS. I propose to read â´yau for âyaú. Bhâmitáh is supported by TS. and Svet. Up., while VS. reads bhâmínah, which Mahidhara refers to vîrâ´n. The last line is the same in RV. and VS., but the TS. reads havíshmanto námasâ vidhema te, while the Svet. Up. reads havishmantah sadasi tvâ havâmahe.
Verse 9.
Note 1. As to the simile, see RV. X, 127, 8, and Muir ST. IV, p. 304, note.
Verse 10.
Note 1. TS. reads drat te, goghná (°é), purushaghné, kshayádvîrâya, rákshâ for mrilâ´, deva brûhi.
Note 2. I take dvibárhâh, which stands for dvibárhah, as an adjective to sárma, or possibly as an adverb, see Lanman, p. 560. It can hardly refer to Rudra, as Grassmann supposes. See J. Schmidt, Pluralbildungen der Neutra, pp. 132 seq.

46,"MANDALA II, HYMN 33.","ASHTAKA II, ADHYÂYA 7, VARGA 16-18.","To Rudra, the Father of the Maruts (the Storm-gods)","1. O father of the Maruts, let thy favour come near, and do not deprive us of the sight of the sun; may the hero (Rudra) be gracious to our horse 1, and may we increase in offspring, O Rudra!
2. May I attain to a hundred winters through the most blissful medicines which thou hast given! Put away far 1 from us all hatred, put away anguish, put away sicknesses in all directions!
3. In beauty thou art the most beautiful of all that exists, O Rudra, the strongest of the strong, thou wielder of the thunderbolt! Carry us happily to the other shore of our anguish, and ward off all assaults of mischief 1.
4. Let us not incense thee, O Rudra, by our worship, not by bad praise, O hero, and not by divided praise! Raise up our men by thy medicines, for I hear thou art the best of all physicians.
5. He who is invoked 1 by invocations and libations, may I pay off 2 that Rudra with my hymns of praise. Let not him who is kind-hearted 3, who readily hears our call, the tawny, with beautiful cheeks, deliver us to this wrath!
6. The manly hero with the Maruts has gladdened me, the suppliant, with more vigorous health. May I without mischief find shade, as if from sunshine 1, may I gain the favour of Rudra!
p. 427
7. O Rudra, where is thy softly stroking hand which cures and relieves 1? Thou, the remover of all heaven-sent mischief, wilt thou, O strong hero, bear with me?
8. I send forth a great, great hymn of praise to the bright tawny bull. Let me reverence 1 the fiery god 2 with prostrations; we celebrate the flaring name 3 of Rudra.
9. He, the fierce god, with strong limbs, assuming many forms, the tawny Rudra, decked himself with brilliant golden ornaments. From Rudra, who is lord of this wide world, divine power 1 will never depart.
10. Worthily thou bearest arrows and bow, worthily, O worshipful 1, the golden, variegated chain; worthily thou cuttest every fiend 2 here to pieces, for there is nothing indeed stronger than thou, O Rudra.
11. Praise him, the famous, sitting in his chariot 1, the youthful, who is fierce and attacks like a terrible wild beast 2 (the lion). And when thou hast been praised, O Rudra, be gracious to him who magnifies thee, and let thy armies 3 mow down others than us!
12. O Rudra, a boy indeed makes obeisance to his father who comes to greet him 1: I praise the lord of brave men, the giver of many gifts, and thou, when thou hast been praised, wilt give us thy medicines.
13. O Maruts, those pure medicines of yours, the most beneficent and delightful, O heroes, those which Manu 1, our father, chose, those I crave from Rudra, as health and wealth.
14. May the weapon of Rudra avoid us 1, may the great anger of the flaring one pass us by.

[paragraph continues]
Unstring thy strong bows 2 for the sake of our liberal lords, O bounteous Rudra, be gracious to our kith and kin.

NOTES.
Ascribed to Gritsamada. Metre, Trishtubh. See Muir, S. T. IV, 309; Geldner and Kaegi, p. 90. Bergaigne, III, 153; Leop. v. Schroeder, Indiens Literatur and Cultur, 343. Verse 1 = TB. II, 8, 6, 9; verse 2 = TB. II, 8, 6, 8; verse 10 = TÂ. IV, 5, 7; verse 11 =TS. IV, 5, 10, 3; AV. XVIII, 1, 40; verse 14 = VS. XVI, 50; TS. IV, 5, 10. 4; verse 15 = TB. II, 8, 6, 9.
Verse 1.
Note 1. The words abhí nah vîráh árvati kshameta admit of different interpretation. Grassmann has: 'Der Held sei huldreich unsren schnellen Rossen;' Muir: 'May the hero spare our horses;' Ludwig: 'Unser held möge tüchtig zu Rosse sein.' The passages quoted by Ludwig from the Sat. Br. III, 7, 3, 1, and IV, 3, 4, 14, do not bear out the meaning of tüchtig sein, to be strong, they rather mean, to suffer, to submit to, with a dative. Yet vîráh by itself may mean son or offspring (III, 4, 9; VII, 1, 21; 56, 24), and if abhi-ksham in our passage could mean to be capable and strong, Ludwig's translation would be justified. But if we take vîrá, hero, as intended for Rudra, as Indra also is often called simply vîra, abhi kshameta would lend itself to the translation of 'to be gracious,' or 'to spare,' and I therefore translate: 'May the hero (Rudra) be gracious to our horse.' It should be understood in the same sense in verse 7, at least I see no reason to vary the translation as Geldner does, and also Ludwig, while Muir is right and consistent. Our poet uses the verb abhiksham frequently, II, 28, 3; 29, 2 (abhikshantârah?). It seems confined to the second Mandala.
Verse 2.
Note 1. Vitarám, wherever it occurs, is always joined with ví in the Rig-veda.
p. 430
Verse 3.
Note 1. If rápas is derived from rap, to whisper, it would have meant originally what is whispered, that is, slander, accusation, and then only crime. Latin crîmen also meant originally what is heard, Leumund. Crîmen is not connected with the Greek κρίνω. The î in crîmen has to be accounted for like the î in lîber, from lubh (libh). The r is irregular, unless we find an analogy in increpare.
Verse 5.
Note 1. Hávate, we expect hûyáte. Ludwig's explanation has not solved the difficulty, and suhávah points back to yo havate. Oldenberg suggests an anacoluthon, He who invokes—may I.
Note 2. I formerly took áva dishîya in the sense of 'to unloose,' used originally with reference to tethered horses. As horses are unloosed before they can do their work, so the gods are, as it were, unloosed by prayer, or set off, so that they may fulfil what they are asked to do; see RV. I. 25, 3. In the passage quoted by Ludwig from the TS. I, 8, 6, 2, the same meaning seemed quite appropriate: áva Rudrám adimahi—yáthâ nah sréyasah kárat, 'We unloosed Rudra, that he might make us happier.' Ludwig takes it to mean, 'We have bound, tied, or obliged Rudra, so that he make us happy,' but the preposition ava is against this interpretation. Muir proposes 'to avert' or 'to propitiate,' the latter being adopted by Geldner.
However, in an article lately published by Roth on Wergeld in the Veda (Z. D. M. G. XLI, 672), ava-day has been recognised as an almost technical legal term, meaning 'to pay off, to compound.' Thus, Tândya Br. XVI, 1, 12, we read yâh satam vairam tad devân avadayate, 'He portions off, i. e. he satisfies, or pacifies, the gods who were offended, by giving a hundred cows.' With nih, we find TB. I, 6, 10, 1. pragâ´ rudrâ´n nír áva dayate; the same occurs in Maitr. S. I, 10, 20, where we also read, griheshv eva Rudram nir ava dayata esha te Rudra bhâgas. See also Ait. Br. II, 7, 1. There is a verse quoted, ávâmba Rudrám adimahi, in TS. I, 8, 6, 2;
p. 431
and again in MS. I, 10, 4; Kâth. IX, 7; Kap. S. VIII, 10; VS. III, 58, and this gives us the right key to our verse, namely, 'May I pay off, may I pacify, Rudra with my songs of praise,' dishîya being the optat. of the aorist, adimahi the aor. ind.
Note 3. On ridûdárah, see Benfey, Quantitätsversch. V, 1; p. 25; Geldner, K. Z. XXVIII, 201; Ludwig, Süsses in seinem bauche habend; Bergaigne, miséricordieux. The meaning is doubtful.
Verse 6.
Note 1. Ghrínîva, divided into ghríni-iva, is a difficult form. Various attempts have been made to explain it. Grassmann translates: 'Wie Schatten von der Gluth mög unversehrt ich des Rudra Huld erreichen,' preferring to write ghriner va. Ludwig, in his notes: 'Bei hitze,' taking ghrini as a locative. Muir: 'Shade in the heat.' Geldner: 'Vor Sonnengluth den Schatten,' taking ghrinî as an instrumental. Lanman (p. 379) takes the same view, though he admits that this would be the only example of an instrumental in the masculine, contracted to î. He translates: 'As by the heat unharmed, to shelter bring me.' He adds: 'It may be ablative with elision and crasis,' and this is likewise Roth's view. Weber thinks that we may retain ghrinîva in the Samhitâ text, but should divide it into ghrinî-iva, 'like a man suffering from heat' (Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 58). I think we must take into account a parallel passage, VI, 16, 38. ûpa khâyâ´m iva ghríneh áganma sárma te vayám, see M. M., Preface to translation of Rig-veda, p. cxliii. Probably the apparent irregularity of the metre led to the change of ghríner iva to ghrínîva, but ghríner iva can be scanned   ̆  ̄  ̆; see M. M., l. c., p. cxlviii.
Verse 7.
Note 1. Gálâsha by itself occurs but once more as an epithet of Rudra, VII, 35, 6, and twice in composition, gálâshabheshaga; see I, 43, 4. The second pâda begins with hástah.
p. 432
Verse 8.
Note 1. Namasyá is difficult, but we can hardly take it for namasyâmasi, masi being supplied from grinîmasi. Nor do we gain by taking namasyâ´ for an instrumental. Perhaps it is best to take it as a 1st pers. of the imperative.
Note 2. The meaning of kalmalîkin is unknown.
Note 3. I think it is best to translate nâ´ma by name, though, no doubt, it implies more than the mere name. Geldner's 'majestätisch Wesen' is right, but it is only one side of nâma. See VIII, 20, 13, note 1.
Verse 9.
Note 1. On vai, see Delbrück, Syntax, p. 483. On asurya, see von Bradke, Dyaus Asura, pp. 29, 34.
Verse 10.
Note 1. I have changed yagatám into yagata.
Note 2. Árhan idám dayase vísvam ábhvam has been rendered in different ways. Grassmann: 'Du theilst alle diese Macht aus.' Ludwig: 'Du besitzest all dise gewalt.' Geldner: 'Du besitzest höchste Macht.' Muir: 'Thou possessest all this vast world.' Dayase is used, no doubt, in the sense of cutting and distributing, but never in the sense of possessing. In several places, however, it has been translated by to cut and to destroy, e. g. X, 80, 2. agníh vritrâ´ni dayate purû´ni, 'Agni cuts up many enemies.' VI, 22, 9. vísvâh agurya dayase ví mâyâ´h, 'thou destroyest all deceits.' See also IV, 7, 10; VI, 6, 5. As to ábhva in the sense of fiend, we had it before in I, 39, 8. â´ yáh nah ábhvah î´shate, ví tám yuyota. In other places it assumes a more neutral character, meaning monster, or monstrous power; see B.-R. s. v. 'To distribute power' is not a Vedic conception, nor does ábhva ever mean power in the sense of 'ungeheure Macht, or Urkraft' (Delbrück, Chrest. p. 49).
Verse 11.
Note 1. AV. XVIII, 1, 40, has gartasádam gánânâm râ´gânam, and anyám asmát te. Garta-sad, literally, sitting
p. 433
in the hole, probably the place of the chariot where the king sat, separated from the driver. These divided chariots can be seen in the ancient monuments of Assyria and Babylon. The king seems to stand in a box of his own, fighting, while the charioteer holds the reins, so as not to interfere with the king. See, however, Bergaigne, III, 122 seq.; Z. D. M. G. XL, 681.
Note 2. The mrigá bhîmá is probably meant for the lion, cf. I, 154, 2, and Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 78.
Note 3. As to the senâs of Rudra, see TS. IV, 5, 2, 1, senânî; AV. XI, 2, 31; Pâr. Grihy. III, 8, 11.

Note 1. The sense would be better if vándamânam could be changed to vándamânah.
Verse 13.
Note 1. That father Manu obtained health and wealth from Rudra was mentioned before, I, 114, 2, and it is curious that the Vedic authority of Manu's Smriti should be based on the yell-known sentence, yat kimka Manur abravît tad bheshagam, Taitt. Samh. II, 2, 10, 2; cf. M. M., Hist. of Anc. Sansk. Lit. p. 89.
Verse 14.
Note 1. The VS. reads pári no rudrásya hetír vrinaktu, pári tveshásya durmatír aghâyóh. Vrigyâh is the 3rd pers. sing. in s of the aor. opt.
Note 2. Rudra is called sthiradhanvan; see also IV, 4, 5; VIII, 19, 20; X, 116, 5; 6; 120, 4; 134, 2; Maitr. S. II, 9, 9.
Verse 15.
Note 1. Kekitâna, the vocative of the participle.

Ascribed to Bhâradvâga Bârhaspatya. Verse 2 occurs TS. I, 8, 22, 5; AV. VII, 42, 1; verse 3, TS. I, 8, 22, 5; AV. VII, 42, 2. All the four verses, but in a different order (3, 1, 2, 4), in MS. IV, 11, 2; see also Kâth. XI, 12. Metre, Trishtubh.
This is the only hymn addressed to Soma and Rudra. In the Khândogya Up. III, 7 and 9, the Rudras are said to have Indra, while the Maruts have Soma at their head.
It is translated by Geldner and Kaegi.
The whole hymn betrays its secondary character; first by violating the law of decrease, secondly by duals in au before consonants, and thirdly by using a very large number of passages from other hymns. Compare verse 1, pâda c, with V, 1, 5, c; verse 2, pâda c, with I, 24, 9, c; verse 2, pâda d, with VI, 1, 12, d. Phrases like verse 1, pâda d, sám nah bhûtam dvipáde sám kátuhpade, occur again and again, with slight modifications; see I, 114, 1; 157, 3; VII, 54, 1; X, 165, 1. Sumanasyámânâ also is suspicious. It occurs again in the next hymn, the last of the Mandala, in VII, 33, 14, likewise a suspected hymn, and in the tenth Mandala, X, 51, 5; 7.
Verse 2.
Note 1. On víshûkîm, see II, 33, 2.
Note 2. Ámîvâ has been identified with ἀνῑα by Fick, Orient und Occident, III, p. 121. The difficulty is m = n.
Note 3. The AV. reads bâ´dhethâm dûrám nírritim, the AV. and TS. read parâkaíh kritám kid énah prá mumuktam asmát.

Verse 1.
Note 1. The TB. has svadhâ´mne for svadhâ´vne, mîdkúshe for vedháse, and srinotana for srinotu nah. The commentator explains both svadhâmne = svakîyasthânayuktâya, and svadhâvne = svadhâsabdavâkyenânnena yuktâya vâ. On vedhas, see Bartholomae, K. Z. XXVII, 361; Ludwig, Z. D. M. G. XL, 716.
Verse 2.
Note 1. Geldner translates kshayena by 'from his high seat.' The meaning of kshaya in this place seems defined by the parallel expression sâ´mrâgyena.
Verse 3.
Note 1. Svapivâta has been variously translated. Grassmann gives Vielbegehrter; Ludwig, des windhauch in schlaf versenkt; Roth, wohl verstehend, denkend; Geldner, freundlicher; Muir, thou who art easy of access, which seems to me the right rendering; cf. sûpâyana. It is derived from api + vat, which occurs six times in the Rig-veda. As a simple verb it means 'to go near, to attend,' as a causative, the same, or 'to bring near.' Thus, VII; 3, 10. ápi krátum su-kétasam vatema, may we obtain wisdom, full of good thoughts. VII, 60, 6. ápi krátum su-kétasam vátantah, (the gods) obtaining wisdom, full of good thoughts (for their worshippers). X, 20, 1 (X, 25, 1). bhadrám nah ápi vâtaya mánah, let us obtain a good mind. I, 128, 2. tám yagña-sâ´dham ápi vâtayâmasi, we go near to, or we bring near Agni, the performer of the sacrifice. I, 165, 13. mánmâni—api-vâtáyantah, bringing the prayers near, or attending to the prayers. X, 13, 5. pitré putrâ´sah ápi avîvatan ritám, the sons brought the sacrifice to the father.
Api-vâta would then mean approach, or in a more
p. 438
spiritual sense, attention, regard, and su-apivâta would mean either of easy approach, opposed to durdharsha, or full of kind attention and regard. See Muir, ST. IV, p. 314. note. Bergaigne, III, 306, does not help us much, though he points out where the difficulty lies.
The following are the Zend passages in which api-vat occurs, with some notes sent me by Dr. Stein: Apivatahê, Y. 9, 27, 2. p. sg. med. c. Gen. 'Hom, du verstehst dich auf rechte Preissprüche' d. h. kannst sie würdigen;' apivatâitê daênayâo mâzdayaçnôis, V. 9, 2, 47, 'vertraut mit dem Gesetz; daênâ´m zarazca dâṭ apaêca aotât, yt. 9, 26: 'wer das Gesetz lernt und in dasselbe eindringt;' verezyôtûca frâcâ vatôyôtû, Y. 35, 6, 'das richtig erkannte führe er aus und theile es mit;' Y. 44, 18 scheint apivaiti 1. p. sg. med. in der Bedeutung: 'in Erfahrung gebracht haben;' die Stelle ist indess sehr dunkel.
Verse 4.
Note 1. Â´ nah bhaga barhíshi gîvasamsé seems a very simple sentence. It has been translated without any misgivings by Grassmann, Ludwig, Geldner and Kaegi and others.
Grassmann translates: 'Lass lange lebend uns die Streu noch schmücken.'
Ludwig: 'Gib uns anteil an dem barhis als verheiszung des lebens.'
Kaegi and Geldner (or Roth): 'Verstatt uns Theil an Opfer und an Herrschaft.'
Bergaigne often points to such translations with scorn, but after he has written several pages on the words in question, here on gîvasamsa, he is indeed very positive that it means 'formule qui donne la vie' (I, p. 306), but what such a 'formule' is, and how this meaning fits the whole sentence, he does not tell us.
Let us begin with what is clear. Â´ bhaga nah with locative, means 'appoint us to something,' i. e. 'give us something.' Thus I, 121, 15. â´ nah bhaga góshu, means 'divide us, distribute us, appoint us to cows,' i. e. 'give us cows as our share.' The same expression is used when
p. 439
instead of cows or riches, the gods are asked to give long life, glory, or sinlessness. Thus we read, I, 104, 6. sáh tvám nah indra sû´rye sáh apsú anâgâstvé â´ bhaga gîvasamsé, that is,' Indra, allow us to share and rejoice in the sun, in water, in sinlessness and praise of men.' X, 45, 10. â´ tám bhaga sausravaséshu, 'give him, let him share in, good renown.'
When we are once familiar with this phraseology, we cannot doubt that in our passage also we have to translate, let us have our barhis, our homely altar, and good report among men.'
Another word narâsamsa had originally the same meaning as gîvasamsa, but it was chiefly used as a name of Agni. He was called Narâsamsa, i. e. Männerlob, or dyóh sámsa, Himmelslob, as a German poet was once called Frauenlob, not only because he praised women, but because he was praised by women. As we can say, God is my song, the Vedic Rishis might call any god the samsa, i. e. the praise or song of men, of the fathers, or of the gods. So far from agreeing with Bergaigne, 'on comprendrait moins bien qu’une locution dont le sens propre aurait été ""éloge mortel"" e.ût désigné celui qui est loué par le mortel,' nothing is easier and better confirmed by other languages, while the invocation of 'une formule sacrée' is almost unintelligible. If in a later hymn Indra is called gyéshthah mántrah, in X, 50, 4, I should translate, 'thou art the oldest or the best song,' that is, 'the theme of the oldest song,' but not thou art a magic formula. There is no necessity therefore for taking narâsamsa as a possessive compound, possessed of the praise of men, nor must we forget that in words which become almost proper names the accent is by no means always a safe guide.

49,"MANDALA I, HYMN 2.","ASHTAKA I, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 3-4.",To Vâyu,"1. Come hither, O Vâyu, thou beautiful one 1! These Somas are ready, drink of them, hear our call!
2. O Vâyu, the praisers celebrate thee with hymns, they who know the feast-days 1, and have prepared the Soma.
3. O Vâyu, thy satisfying stream 1 goes to the worshipper, wide-reaching, to the Soma-draught.
4. O Indra and Vâyu, these (libations of Soma) are poured out; come hither for the sake of 1 our offerings, for the drops (of Soma) long for you.
5. O Indra and Vâyu, you perceive the libations, you who are rich in booty 1; come then quickly hither!

NOTES.
Ascribed to Madhukkhandas Vaisvâmitra, and addressed to Vâyu (1-3), Indra and Vâyu (4-6), and to Mitra and Varuna (7-9). Metre, Gâyatrî. Verse 4 = VS. VII, 8; XXXIII, 56; TS. I, 4, 4, 1; MS. I. 3, 6. Verse 7 = SV. II, 197; VS. XXXIII, 57: Verse 8 = SV. II, 198. Verse 9 = SV. II, 199.
This hymn, with the hymn I, 3, belongs to the Pra-uga ceremony. It consists of three trikas.
Verse 1.
Note 1. Darsata, as applied to the wind, may be intended for visible, but its more general meaning is conspicuous, clarus, insignis.
Verse 2.
Note 1. Aharvid, which Benfey translates by tagekundig, Grassmann, die des Tages (Anbruch) kundig, seems to have two meanings. When applied to men, poets or priests, it means those who know (vid) the right days or seasons for every sacrifice, but when it is applied to certain deities, particularly those of the morning, it means finding (vind), bringing back the day, like lucifer. Thus the Asvins are called aharvidâ (VIII, 5, 9; 21). The power (daksha) of Vishnu is called aharvid, conquering, or bringing, the light of the day (I, 156, 4). The priests, as inviting these gods, might possibly themselves be called aharvid, bringing back the light of day, but this seems doubtful.
Verse 3.
Note 1. This verse, though it seems easy, is really full of difficulties. The meaning of dhenâ is very doubtful. It is explained as lips by native authorities, and would in that case be derived from dhe, to suck. But though this meaning is possible in some passages, particularly where dhene occurs in the dual, in other passages dhenâ seems clearly to
p. 442
mean a stream of milk, or of some other liquid, poured out (visrishta) from the clouds or at a sacrifice. It often occurs in the dual dhene, and has then been taken as the upper and lower lips (not the nares, as Roth suggests), distinguished from sipre, the upper and lower jaws. See note on II, 34, 3. Sâyana (Rv. Bh. I, 101, 10) explains it by gihvopagihvike. Durga adds (Nirukta Bhâshya, VI, 17) âdhastye damshtre vâ gihvopagihvike vâ, ity eke, tayor hy annam dhîyate.
Benfey translates: 'Vâyu, deine vorkostende Lippe schreitet zum Opferer, weit hingestreckt zum Somatrank.' Prapriñkatî can hardly mean vorkostend.
Verse 4.
Note 1. The instrumental práyobhih is best translated here by 'for the sake of;' see Wenzel, Instrumental, p. 104.
Verse 5.
Note 1. On vâginî and vâga, see 'India, what can it teach us?' pp. 164, 166. The transition of meaning from vâga, booty, to vâga, wealth in general, finds an analogy in the German kriegen, to obtain, also in Gewinn, and A. S. winnan, to strive, to fight, to obtain. Vâginîvasû, in the dual, is a frequent epithet of the Asvins, II, 37, 5; V, 74, 6; 7; 75, 3; 78, 3; VIII, 5, 3; 12; 20; 8, 10; 9, 4; 10, 5; 22, 7; 14; 18; 26, 3; 85, 3; 101, 8; of Indra, III, 42, 5; X, 96, 8.
It differs little from vâginîvat, which is likewise applied to the Asvins, I, 120, 10, and comes to mean simply wealthy, liberal; cf. I, 122, 8; VII, 69, 1. Vâginîvati is an epithet of Ushas, Sarasvatî, and Sindhu. A common phrase is vâ´gebhih vâgínîvatî, lit. wealthy in wealth, cf. I, 3, 10. Vâginî occurs as the feminine of vâgin, wealthy, or strong, but never in the sense of mare; cf. III, 61, 1. úshah vâ´gena vâgini, Ushas wealthy by wealth or booty; VI, 61, 6. Sarasvati vâ´geshu vâgini, Sarasvati, strong in battles; cf. I, 4, 8; 9. Native commentators generally explain vâgini by sacrifice, vâginîvasu, by dwelling in the sacrifice. I take vâgini in compounds like vâginîvasu as a collective
p. 443
substantive, like padminî, ûhinî, vâhinî, tretinî, anîkinî, &c., and in the sense of wealth; unless we may look upon vâginîvat as formed in analogy to such words as tavishî-mat, only that in this case tavishî exists in the sense of strength. Pischel's explanation, Ved. Stud. p. 9, rich in mares, takes for granted the existence of vâgini in the sense of mare. I have not found any passage where vâginî has necessarily that sense.
Verse 6.
Note 1. Nishkrita can hardly mean here what it means in later Sanskrit, a rendezvous.
Note 2. On ítthâ´ dhiyâ´, see Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 184.
Verse 7.
Note 1. Pûtádaksha, cf. pûtákratu, VIII, 68, 17.
Note 2. Ghritâkî seems to be taken here in a technical sense, like ghritavat, i. e. with oblations of butter thrown into the fire. In I, 167, 3, I took ghritâkî in the more general sense of bright, resplendent, while others ascribed to it the meaning of bringing fatness, i. e. rain. It may also mean accompanied by ghee. See B.-R. s. v.
Verse 8.
Note 1. Ritasprís, probably not very different from ritasâ´p.

"
50,"MANDALA I, HYMN 134.","ASHTAKA II, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 23.",To Vâyu,"1. O Vâyu, may the quick racers bring thee towards the offerings, to the early drink 1 here, to the early drink of Soma! May Sûnritâ 2 (the Dawn) stand erect, approving thy mind! Come near on thy harnessed chariot to share, O Vâyu, to share in the sacrifice 3!
2. May the delightful drops of Soma delight thee, the drops made by us, well-made, and heaven-directed, yes, made with milk, and heaven-directed. When his performed aids assume strength for achievement, cur prayers implore the assembled steeds for gifts, yes, the prayers implore them.
3. Vâyu yokes the two ruddy, Vâyu yokes the two red horses, Vâyu yokes to the chariot the two swift horses to draw in the yoke, the strongest to draw in the yoke. Awake Purandhi (the Morning) 1 as a lover wakes a sleeping maid, reveal heaven and earth, brighten the dawn, yes, for glory brighten the dawn.
4. For thee the bright dawns spread out in the distance beautiful garments, in their houses 1, in their rays, beautiful in their new rays. To thee the juice-yielding 2 cow pours out all treasures. Thou hast brought forth the Maruts from the flanks 3, yes, from the flanks of heaven.
5. For thee the white, bright, rushing Somas, strong in raptures, have rushed to the whirl, they
p. 445
have rushed to the whirl of the waters. The tired hunter asks luck of thee in the chase 1; thou shieldest 2 by thy power from every being, yes, thou shieldest by thy power from powerful spirits 3.
6. Thou, O Vâyu, art worthy as the first before all others to drink these our Somas, thou art worthy to drink these poured-out Somas. Among the people also who invoke thee and have turned to thee 1, all the cows pour out the milk, they pour out butter and milk (for the Soma).
p. 446
NOTES.
Ascribed to Parukkhepa Daivodâsi, and addressed to Vâyu. Metre, 1-5 Atyashti; 6 Ashti. No verse occurs in the other Vedas.
Verse 1.
Note 1. Pûrvapîti may here imply that Vâyu receives his libation first, before the other gods, see verse 6.
Note 2. Whatever the etymology of sûnritâ may be, in our passage, which describes the morning sacrifice and the arrival of Vâyu as the first of the gods, it can hardly mean anything but dawn. Ûrdhvâ sthâ is an expression applied frequently to the rise of the dawn or the morning, see III, 55, 14; 61, 3; VIII, 45, 12. In the last passage sûnritâ is simply the dawn. Ludwig translates, 'deine treflichkeit erhebe sich, günstig aufnemend die absicht.' He, like Bergaigne, III, 295, takes sûnritâ as su-nri-tâ, virtue. It seems to me that sûnrita may be formed irregularly in analogy to an-rita, and then mean true, good. In other places sûnritam seems to mean hymn, like ritavâka, IX, 113, 2. In places where it occurs as a name of Ushas, one feels tempted to conjecture su-nritûs. See also Bartholomae, in Bezzenb. Beitr. XV, 24.
Note 3. On makhásya dâváne, see note to I, 6, 8; but also note to VIII, 7, 27.
Verse 2.
My translation is purely tentative, and I doubt whether the text can be correct. I have taken krâna here in the sense of made, but I am quite aware that this meaning becomes incongruous in our very verse, when repeated for the third time. On its other meanings, see Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 67. For the whole verse, compare VI, 36, 3. Grassmann translates:


Ludwig: Erfreuen sollen dich die frohen tropfen, Vâyu, von uns bereitet, die morgendlichen, mit milch bereitet, die morgendlichen, dasz der (opfer) tüchtigkeit zukomen hilfleistungen zum gelingen, gewärt, die insgesammt herwärts gerichteten gespanne (antworten) zur (mit) beschenkung den liedern, ihn sprechen an die lieder.
These translations may serve to show that certain verses in the Veda are simply hopeless, and that the translators must not be held responsible if they cannot achieve the impossible.
Verse 3.
Note 1. Purandhi may have meant originally doorkeeper or bar-holder (cardo), from pûh and dhi, being formed like ishudhí, vríshandhi, sevadhí, &c. Purandhrî also may have been πυλωρός, janitor, or rather janitrix, then housewife. Grassmann translates it by Segensfülle, Ludwig by Fülle; Bergaigne, III, 476, has a long note on purandhi, as one of the many names of 'la femelle.' Whatever it meant etymologically, in our passage, where she is to be woke by the wind in the morning (cf. ushásah budhí, I, 137, 2), it is again a characteristic epithet of the dawn, πολιοῦχος, πολιάς, ποαῖτις. See also Pischel, Vedica, p. 202; Hillebrandt, Wiener Zeitschrift, III, 188; 259.
Verse 4.
Note 1. I have translated damsu as a locative; could it be a nom. plur. of damsu, δασυ, referring to vastrâ, the terminations being left out? see Lanman, p. 415.
Note 2. Sabardúghâ, juice-yielding. Roth explains it as quickly yielding, identifying sabar with Greek ἄφαρ. But Greek φ never represents Sanskrit b. Sabar, juice, milk, water, would really seem to yield the true source of A. S. sæp, O. H. G. saf, sap, for it is clear that neither ὀπός, nor Lat. sucus, would correspond with A. S. sæp; see Brugmann, Grundriss, vol. i, § 328; also Bartholomae, in, Bezzenb. Beitr. XV, 17.
p. 448
Note 3. Vakshánâbhyah, from the flanks. It would be better if we could refer vákshanâbhyah to Dhenu, the cow, the mother of the Maruts, while Dyaus is their father, see V, 52, 16. Here, however, Vâyu is conceived as their father, and dyaus (fem.) as their mother.
Verse 5.
Note 1. I have followed Ludwig in his explanation of tsârî, hunter, watcher, and takvavîya, chase of the takva, whatever animal it may be.
Note 2. Oldenberg suggests prâ´si for pâsi, which on many accounts would be excellent.
Note 3. On asuryă, see von Bradke, Dyaus Asura, p. 39, and Bergaigne, Journal Asiatique, 1884, p. 510.
Verse 6.
Note 1. Vihutmat is translated by Roth as not sacrificing. But vihutmat can hardly be separated from vihava and vihavya, and seems to mean therefore invoking, possibly, invoking towards different sides. Hu, to sacrifice, does not take the preposition vi. Vavargushî is doubtful. Without some other words, it can hardly mean 'those who have turned towards the gods,' as we read in X, 120, 3 (tvé krátum ápi vriñganti vísve); nor is it likely to be the same as vrikta-barhis, 'those who have prepared the barhis.'
I have translated it in the former sense. See Geldner, Ved. Stud. p. 144, and Oldenberg, Gött. Gel. Anz. 1890, p. 414.

51,"MANDALA X, HYMN 168.","ASHTAKA VIII, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 26.",To Vâta,"1. Now for the greatness of the chariot of Vâta 1! Its roar goes crashing and thundering. It moves touching the sky, and creating red sheens 2, or it goes scattering the dust of the earth.
2. Afterwards there rise the gusts of Vâta 1, they go towards him, like women to a feast 2. The god goes with them on the same chariot, he, the king of the whole of this world.
3. When he moves on his paths along the sky, he rests not even a single day 1; the friend of the waters, the first-born, the holy, where was he born, whence did he spring?
4. The breath of the gods, the germ 1 of the world, that god moves wherever he listeth; his roars indeed are heard, not his form—let us offer sacrifice to that Vâta!

NOTES.
Ascribed to Anila Vâtâyana, and addressed to Vâyu, here called Vâta. The metre is Trishtubh. This hymn does not occur in the other Vedas. See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, V, p. 145; Geldner and Kaegi, p. 95.
Verse 1.
Note 1. For this use of the accusative, see Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 13.
Note 2. Arunâni is explained by Geldner, Ved. Stud. p. 274, as the reddish colours of the lightning.
Verse 2.
Note 1. Vishthâ means kind or variety. Anu seems to refer to ratha, which I take as the subject of the whole of the first verse.
Note 2. 'Sie gehn mit einander zum Tanz,' Geldner and Kaegi.
Verse 3.
Note 1. Geldner and Kaegi propose aha for ahah.
Verse 4.
Note 1. Vâta seems to be called the garbha of the world, in the sense of being its source or life.
